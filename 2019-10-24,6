Tesla demonstrated its ability to turn a profit on its vehicles in the third quarter, sending its stock soaring 18% higher in after-hours trading. Despite being forecast to lose money in the period and missing estimates on sales, the electric-car maker managed to swing to a large profit.

Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA) has been on a roll recently—up 21% since late August—but it remained down for the year through Wednesday’s close. It had dropped 23.5% in 2019, to $254.68, while the S&P 500 had returned 21.5% including dividends. Tesla stock also lagged other auto makers: Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) stocks were up 28.4% and 12.8%, respectively, in 2019 through Wednesday.

In the third quarter reported Wednesday, Tesla said it earned an adjusted $342 million, or $1.91 per share. That’s down from $2.90 in adjusted earnings per share in the same period in 2018, but far ahead of analysts’ consensus expectation of a loss of 46 cents. Estimates ranged from a loss of $3.52 a share to a profit of 34 cents.

Revenue came in at $6.3 billion in the third quarter versus estimates of $6.45 billion. For the third quarter of 2018, Tesla reported $6.82 billion in sales.

Tesla had released its third-quarter delivery numbers on Oct. 3. It said it delivered 97,000 vehicles, including 79,600 Model 3s and a total of 17,400 of Models S and X. Analysts had been expecting a total of 99,000 vehicles delivered in the quarter.

Tesla also posted much higher than expected free cash flow in the third quarter, at $371 million. Estimates had ranged from negative $476 million to positive $450 million. Tesla had generated free cash flow in only five quarters over the past five years before Wednesday’s report, and it had burned a cumulative $8 billion in free cash flow. The company’s cash and cash equivalents stood at $5.3 billion at the end of the third quarter.

Tesla said it expects to post “positive quarterly free cash flow going forward, with possible temporary exceptions, particularly around the launch and ramp of new products.” It also sees positive net income going forward. That means the company believes it can fund its own growth and won’t need to issue new shares or debt.

Tesla said it expects to deliver more than 360,000 vehicles in 2019 and expects the Model Y crossover to launch next summer, ahead of its previous schedule.

Tesla management, including CEO Elon Musk, is scheduled to hold a conference call with analysts at 6:30 p.m. ET. Investors will be looking for updates on the demand for Tesla’s vehicles and progress on ramping production to meet it. They’ll also be listening for new details about coming models, including the Model Y crossover.

Tesla’s second-quarter adjusted earnings and sales, reported on July 24, were both below analysts’ average expectations. The stock fell nearly 14% the next day.

Wall Street analysts are divided on the stock. Thirty-three percent have a Buy or equivalent rating, while 33% recommend a Sell. Their average price target is $269.19, about 6% above the stock’s Wednesday closing price.

Tesla shares were up 18%, at $300, in premarket trading at 6:17 a.m. Thursday.

Tesla’s third-quarter revenue was $6.3 billion. An earlier version of this article incorrectly gave the figure as $5.35 billion.
