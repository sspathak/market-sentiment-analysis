Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas on Wednesday started covering Tesla Inc. TSLA, +9.56% stock, rating it their equivalent of buy, saying that Tesla "has a unique opportunity to capitalize on rising consumer appetite -- and political will -- for a new electrified era." The analysts set a $300 price target on the stock, a 25% upside from Wednesday's price. No other electric vehicle travels further and charges faster than a Tesla, which matters to car buyers and leaves the company well placed to compete for a market the analysts model at about 10 million vehicles. "We see Tesla volumes tripling to (one million) units by 2025," the Exane BNP Paribas analysts, led by Stuart Pearson, said in a note. Tesla shares have lost 27% this year, contrasting with gains of 15% for the S&P 500 index.
