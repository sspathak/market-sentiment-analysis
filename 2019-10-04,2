Investors who see Tesla as a “hypergrowth” stock should dial their expectations back, an analyst wrote Friday.

Tesla stock (TSLA), which closed Thursday at $233.13, was down 1.7% at $228.99 at 10:35 a.m. Friday as Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy—one of the Street’s bigger bears—predicted an 8% year-over-year revenue dip in the third quarter. He has an Underperform rating on the stock and a price target of $189, well below the average of $271 among analysts tracked by FactSet. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 131.82 points, or 0.5%, to 26,332.86, while the S&P 500 has gained 0.5% to 2924.49.

A fall in revenue would represent the first such dip since 2012, Levy noted.

“To be fair, we forecast continued growth for Tesla beyond this year, as Tesla increases its volumes, driven by [the] Model Y and China,” he wrote. “Yet for a stock with elevated valuation driven by prospects of hypergrowth, the third-quarter print is a reminder that the Tesla growth story may not be as robust as the bulls hope for.”

Levy’s prediction suggests quarterly revenue around $6.29 billion, below FactSet’s $6.47 billion estimate and last year’s $6.82 billion.

Wall Street is looking for 2019 revenue of $23.5 billion, about $1 billion below FactSet’s consensus estimate.

Tesla reported third-quarter delivery and production data Wednesday evening, turning in numbers that disappointed investors. The report, which included some information about the company’s mix of models and leases, offers clues as to its full third-quarter results. The stock fell 4% Thursday in response to the news.

Levy also gave a gloomier forecast for full-year per-share losses. He now says the loss is likely to be $4.37, compared with his previous forecast of $4.14. Wall Street anticipates a loss of $4.12 per share. Gross margins, which he sees falling year over year in the third-quarter, could be part of the reason.

“On the positive side, mix was likely richer, volume was higher (i.e. better fixed cost absorption), and Tesla likely saw better manufacturing efficiency,” he wrote. “Yet given the price reduction at the start of the third quarter, we see gross margin weakening.”
