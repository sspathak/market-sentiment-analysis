Shares of Tesla fell Thursday after the electric auto maker disappointed investors with its release of third-quarter delivery and production numbers after the market’s close Wednesday.

Tesla stock (TSLA), which closed yesterday at $243.13, was recently down 5.6% to $229.42 as the S&P 500 rose 0.5%. The company said Wednesday evening that it delivered fewer vehicles than expected based on FactSet’s consensus expectation, though more than it reported in the second quarter.

Attention now turns to the company’s full third-quarter financial results, among other things. In that report, Tesla may update investors on its outlook for the rest of the year and beyond.

The company has yet to address its standing full-year delivery guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles; it would take more than 105,000 fourth-quarter deliveries, a company record, to meet the low end of that range. Meanwhile, Wall Street expects a loss, according to FactSet, though CEO Elon Musk has said a break-even quarter is likely.

Here’s a selection of analyst comments published in the wake of Wednesday night’s announcement. FactSet’s average price target on the stock is $267.

• Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer has an Outperform rating and a $356 price target on the stock.

“All eyes will now turn to manufacturing margins and cash flow for the quarter,” he wrote. “We believe the mix of shipments to Europe will be a key driver for margins as we believe the company is enjoying higher value mix in Europe and is shipping increasing volumes to Europe. We expect shares to recover from the aftermarket selloff as investors process the potential cash generation for the quarter.”

• At Baird, Ben Kallo has an Outperform rating and a $355 price target on Tesla stock.

“We do expect gross margins will continue to expand, driven by higher volumes, increased manufacturing efficiency, and lower logistics costs,” he wrote. “That said, there are many unknowns (including leasing impacts, service margins, etc.) which could hinder profitability in the near term.”

• Jed Dorsheimer at Canaccord Genuity has a Buy rating and a $350 price target on the stock.

“We view these results as a strong indicator that the ‘demand cliff’ associated with reduction in second-quarter federal tax credits in the U.S. was not rooted in the data,” he wrote. “Instead we see this as a datapoint in favor of latent electric vehicle demand compared to internal combustion engine sales. Importantly, the company cited record net orders generated during the quarter that exceeded deliveries resulting in an increase to the backlog at the end of the quarter.”

• Nomura Instinet’s Christopher Eberle reiterated a Neutral rating and a $270 price target on Tesla stock.

“Our checks indicate that Model 3 demand remains strong,” he wrote. ”We continue to look at Tesla’s U.S. Model 3 sales within the context of the entry luxury sedan segment. Model 3 rose to above 50% market share in 4Q18 and has largely maintained this level.”

• At Morgan Stanley, Adam Jonas reiterated an Equal Weight rating and a $230 price target.

“The release of the third-quarter delivery number was slightly below many real-time buy-side expectations, lending support to bears who see fundamental pressure ahead of third-quarter results,” he wrote.

• John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch has an Underperform rating and a $225 price target on Tesla.

“At the low end of the full-year outlook range, the implied fourth-quarter deliveries seems plausible, although it is relatively uninspiring in terms of the volume growth trajectory,” he wrote. “On the other end of the spectrum at the high end of the range, the implied fourth-quarter deliveries appears somewhat optimistic, particularly given the slowing sequential growth.”

• Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained a Neutral rating and a $220 price target on the stock.

“The question on the minds of investors is around profits into 2020,” he wrote. “The stock will be rangebound in our opinion until Musk & Co. update the Street with the financial results, profitability picture, and fourth-quarter guidance later this month trying to regain the credibility of the Street.”

• Ryan Brinkman at JPMorgan reiterated an Underweight rating and maintained a $200 price target, extending it to December 2020 from December 2019.

“After not surprising 3Q deliveries materially to the upside (the firm targeted a sequential improvement vs. 2Q’s 95,356 deliveries, and media reports indicate the company was recently internally targeting as many as 100,000 deliveries), achieving full-year guidance now looks even harder,” he wrote.

• Citi Research analyst Itay Michaeli has a $191 target price and a Sell rating on the shares.

“The release didn’t specifically confirm Tesla’s 2019 delivery guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles, for which the low-end now requires about 105,000 delivery units in the fourth quarter,” he wrote. “With the shares having held-up well into the third-quarter delivery report, we’d expect a pullback on these results.”

• RBC Capital Markets’ Joseph Spak has an Underperform rating and a $190 price target on the stock.

“Tesla disclosed that 15% of Model S/X (about 10% last quarter) and 8% of Model 3s (about 5.6% last quarter) were subject to lease accounting,” he wrote. “The higher lease percentage will likely have a negative impact on revenue. However, an offset (of unknown impact) is how much the release of deferred revenue from new features such as Smart Summon will help the quarter.”

• At JMP Securities, Joseph Osha downgraded the stock to Market Perform.

“The delivery data show low-single-digit sequential unit growth, and we know of no operational issues that could have prevented Tesla from delivering more vehicles if demand were available,” he wrote. “To put it another way, yesterday’s announcement was the first time since covering the stock that we found ourselves wondering whether demand growth for Tesla’s cars might be leveling off.”

• Rajvindra Gill of Needham has an Underperform rating on the shares.

“Given the decelerating revenue growth in 2019 and ongoing gross margin pressure, we expect net losses to exceed the losses in 2018, placing more pressure on what we see as an already expensive valuation,” he wrote.
