Tesla stock has been on a roll since late August, up nearly 21%. The electric car maker’s next test comes on Wednesday evening, when it reports third-quarter earnings after the market closes.

Investors will be looking for updates on demand for Tesla’s vehicles and progress on ramping production to meet it. They’ll also be listening for new details about coming models, including the Model Y crossover.

Despite its recent bump, Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA) is still down for the year and far behind the broader market. It has dropped 23.2% in 2019 through Tuesday’s close, to $255.58, while the S&P 500 has returned 21.9% including dividends. Tesla stock is also lagging other auto makers: Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) stocks are up 26.4% and 11.9%, respectively, year to date.

Here’s a snapshot of Wall Street’s expectations and some recent history.

• Tesla released its third-quarter delivery numbers on Oct. 3. It said it delivered 97,000 vehicles, including 79,600 Model 3s and a total of 17,400 of Models S and X. Analysts had been expecting a total of 99,000 vehicles delivered in the quarter.

• With its delivery numbers already published, the focus will be on the electric-vehicle maker’s third-quarter profits and cash flow when it reports on Wednesday. Analysts on average expect Tesla to report a loss of 46 cents per share, down from $2.90 in adjusted earnings per share in the same period in 2018. But the range of estimates goes from a loss of $3.52 on the low end, to a profit of 34 cents a share at the high end. Revenue is estimated at $6.45 billion, down from $6.82 billion a year earlier.

• Analysts’ consensus view is for Tesla to just eke out free cash flow in the third quarter, at $32 million. Once again, that average figure obscures a wide range of estimates: from -$476 million to +$450 million. Tesla has only generated free cash flow in five quarters over the past five years, and has burned a cumulative $8 billion in free cash flow.

• Tesla’s second-quarter adjusted earnings and sales, reported on July 24, were both below analysts’ average expectations. The stock fell nearly 14% the next day.

• Wall Street analysts are divided on the stock: 33% have a Buy or equivalent rating, while 33% recommend a Sell. Their average price target is $269.19, about 5% above the stock’s Tuesday closing price.

• Tesla management will host a conference call with analysts on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. ET.
