Tesla stock is soaring to new heights on Tuesday—again. Shares of the electric-vehicle pioneer have been on a warpath, nearing the $1,000 mark. The stock was up 18.7%, at $925.45, in recent trading, while the S&P 500 was up 1.7%. For reference, it fell as low as $176.99 in intraday trading this past June.

If Tesla stock holds on, it would have gained more than $68 billion in market cap in the last six days, according to Dow Jones Market Data. As recently as early December, Tesla’s total market cap was less than $60 billion.

Tesla’s market value was on track to cross the $160 billion line on Tuesday. That dwarfs the combined market value of Ford Motor (F), General Motors (GM), and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU). Globally, the only competitor Tesla trails is Toyota Motor (TM) at $193.7 billion.

Tesla short interest—the percentage of shares available for trading that have been sold short—has recently fallen to its lowest levels since Tesla stock first started trading in 2010. That means short sellers—investors who sell borrowed shares to bet on a fall in price—are backing off, for now.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note Tuesday that the company’s prospects in China and improved profitability profile, as well as bullish comments from Panasonic (6752.Japan) about its battery partnership with Tesla, have helped drive the continued rally.

Ives reiterated a long-term bull case scenario on the stock at $1,000, noting Tesla’s ability to ramp up production in China in 2020 and 2021 amid growing demand will be a major swing factor. For now, he has a Neutral rating and a $710 price target on the stock.
