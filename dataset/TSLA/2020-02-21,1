A stock-market meltup is happening right under our noses. And though we don’t quite have a definite sign that a bubble in equities is forming, several market statistics are concerning. 

They suggest it might be best to prepare for a post-bubble correction of 10% or more.

On the surface, things look calm. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.4% this past week, snapping two weeks of solid gains. The benchmark is up 1.9% for the year. The S&P 500 index dropped 1.2% for the week and is up 3.6% for the year. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.6% on the week and is up 6.9% year to date. None of those numbers point to a bubble.

It is what’s going on under the surface that looks worrisome. Growth stocks are dominating value stocks, blowing past dot-com-era outperformance levels. “The last time we got to these levels, the bubble burst and a 50%-plus global bear market began,” Citigroup strategist Robert Buckland pointed out in a Friday research report.

Consider the trading action in the market’s most popular stocks. The FAANGs— Facebook (ticker: FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL)—are up 10% year to date, adding more than $330 billion in market value to the S&P 500. What’s more, the average price/earnings ratio for FAANG stocks has jumped to 35 times estimated earnings from 21 times last year.

Microsoft (MSFT)—an honorary FAANG member, with its $1.4 trillion market capitalization—is also something to behold. Shares are up 14% in 2020 and 65% over the past year, and now trade for 31 times estimated earnings. The last time the stock reached today’s valuation levels was in 2002, soon after the dot-com bubble burst.

It isn’t just rising valuations that should concern investors. There’s the options market, too. Microsoft’s bullish call-option volume, for instance, is blowing away bearish put-option volume, with the ratio up about 60% year over year. That’s significant because, as one colorful trader told Barron’s, “screen monkeys lifting quotes” helps fuel market froth.

Total trading in all options for the FAANG-plus-Microsoft group is also up about 60% year over year—and traders are buying more calls than usual. The action is undeniably bullish. It is possibly euphoric. The options-trading action is the closest thing to a smoking gun out there.

What to do? Sell stocks as they rise—or learn to trade the momentum?

At some point, value stocks will outperform growth stocks. The problem is investors who followed that path have underperformed for years. There are, after all, a lot of energy stocks—which have been slammed by low oil prices—in the value indexes. What about home-builder stocks? The group still trades at a modest price/earnings ratio, and recent U.S. housing data have been solid. The sector is up year to date, but the options market isn’t pointing to a bubble in housing stocks.

Besides sector rotation, one could sell down portfolio exposure—taking some money off the table. That can be painful, but prudent.

We aren’t calling the end of the bull market in U.S. stocks. Yet. But the market is overbought, in Wall Street parlance. That means bullish sentiment is high and a correction is due. A 10% drop to 3000 in the S&P 500—near the index’s 200-day moving average—wouldn’t surprise seasoned traders. In fact, the market is as far away from its 200-day moving average as it has been since late 2017. (That was followed by—wait for it—a correction.)

Bull markets don’t die of old age, as they say on the Street. Something has to happen to derail global growth. It could be the coronavirus outbreak in China. It could be slowing commercial construction activity in the U. S.—something Deere (DE) hinted at during its conference call on Friday.

Investors ignored Deere’s warning and sent its shares up 7% in trading on Friday. Deere left its full-year earnings guidance unchanged.

That’s another sign of a stock market bubble: ignoring bad news.

The Long and the Short
Here’s what else caught our attention this past week:

• The Markit U.S. Service Business Activity Index came in at 49.4. Economists expected 53.4. The reading, which was a 76-month low, was the big reason stocks dropped on Friday. 

• Gold prices rose 3.7%. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield hit a 52-week low on Friday, while yields dipped to 1.9%.

• E*Trade Financial shares (ETFC) soared about 21% after Morgan Stanley (MS) announced that it was buying the online broker. ViacomCBS shares (VIAC) dropped more than 19% after the company reported disappointing earnings on Thursday.

• It was another big week for Tesla (TSLA) investors. Shares of the electric-vehicle pioneer gained another 13% and have risen for 12 consecutive weeks. They are up about 115% year to date. The run has been remarkable.

• Not even Tesla stock could catch Virgin Galactic Holdings (SPCE). Its shares soared more than 18% and are up 193% year to date. The company reports quarterly earnings on Tuesday after the market close.
