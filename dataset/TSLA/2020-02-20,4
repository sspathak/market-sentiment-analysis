Three numbers to start your day:

Tesla Rallied 6.9% on Wednesday.
The electric vehicle maker’s stock has more than doubled this year, thanks to a couple of solid quarterly reports and the opening of a factory in China.

Earlier this week, Tesla (TSLA) gained because a handful of skeptics raised their price targets on the stock.

Another analyst raised his price target to $928 on Wednesday. He highlighted the company’s side businesses, such as battery storage and solar-panel installation.

But that analyst was bullish beforehand—so it wasn’t much of a change. So what’s going on? Honestly, it’s hard to say. These days, it seems like Tesla’s stock is looking for any reason to rally.

Coronavirus Could Cut $1.1 Trillion From The Global Economy This Year
—in the worst-case scenario, at least. If the virus spreads further than experts expect, global economic growth could grind to a halt in the first half of this year. That’s according to Oxford Economics. And that could push the U.S. and Europe into “technical recessions,” meaning two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.

Again, this is a worst-case scenario. For now, experts don’t think the outbreak will spread outside of Asia. In that case, it will drag down global GDP by $400 billion.

Shares of Bed Bath and Beyond Rallied 7.7% on Wednesday
—after it announced a $1 billion capital allocation plan.

Here’s how the retailer will spend that $1 billion of cash: About $600 million will either go to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks, or be used to pay down debt. And up to $400 million will be invested back in the business.

The company also decided to sell a business called PersonalizationMall.com. That’s a website that sells personalized gifts and decor, in case you didn’t know.

Wednesday’s gains weren’t enough to make up for the selloff that hit the stock last week. It’s declined 15% since the retailer warned investors that its turnaround is taking longer than it expected.
