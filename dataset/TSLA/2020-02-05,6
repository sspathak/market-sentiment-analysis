U.S. markets are poised for another rally as worry about coronavirus abated following reports from China of potential treatments and vaccines for the disease.

Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 235 points, or 0.8%, premarket, matching a similar gain in S&P 500 futures. Nasdaq Composite futures were up 1%.

But despite the broad gains, some individual stocks were falling.

Tesla’s (ticker: TLSA) baffling ascent finally appeared to find some resistance Wednesday morning. Shares were down 3% premarket after climbing 13.7% Tuesday and roughly 20% Monday.

Meanwhile, Ford Motor (F) saw its shares plunge nearly 8% premarket after reporting dismal fourth-quarter results Tuesday evening. The auto maker reported a net loss of $1.7 billion in the quarter due in part to previously disclosed pension obligations. Ford’s outlook for 2020 was also weaker than expected.

Merck (MRK) shares fell 1.8% after the drugmaker reported a drop in sales. Merck also announced plans to spin off its women’s health operation, some older drugs, and its biosimilars business in an effort to streamline operations.

Snap shares fell 7% after the owner of Snapchat revealed fourth- quarter revenue figures that came in below expectations. Guidance for the first quarter also disappointed Wall Street.
