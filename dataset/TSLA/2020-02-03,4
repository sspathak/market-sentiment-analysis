With the S&P 500 down only 2.4% from its January record close, market participants were taking stock of current levels and the potential, long-term effects of the outbreak.

“There is optimism that we’re going to be able to contain the virus,” said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management. “But my concern is really going back to the Chinese market,” he told MarketWatch, noting that trading was halted on shares of hundreds of companies Monday after prices fell 10%, triggering mandatory holds. “That’s dangerous and we don’t know how much lower they would have gone.”

Also helping drive gains in U.S. stocks were data on the manufacturing sector from the Institute for Supply Management, whose purchasing manager’s index rose to a six-month high of 50.9% in January, versus expectations of a 48.5% reading, according to a MarketWatch poll of economists. A reading above 50% indicates expansion, while below 50% indicates contraction.

“Manufacturing came out better than expected,” Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management told MarketWatch. “Overall, the economic data is still okay, and not likely to change for another month or two. Then, we might see some impact of the virus work its way through the data.”

Overnight Monday, Chinese stocks plunged on their first day of trading since Jan. 24, the start of an extended Lunar New Year holiday that coincided with the rapid spread of the illness, which has drawn comparisons with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, beginning in 2002.

The Shenzhen Composite 399106, +0.00%  dropped 8.4%, while the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, -0.21%  fell 7.7%, marking the worst daily tumble for that index since 2015. Chinese equity markets had been closed since Jan. 24 for the New Year holiday.

The People’s Bank of China said it would inject about $174 billion into the economy to stem the economic downturn, along with other measures to stabilize the economy.

In other data, the Commerce Department said construction spending fell 0.2% in December, versus expected growth of 0.6%, according to a MarketWatch poll.

Meanwhile, investors are also keeping an eye on developments tied to the 2020 presidential election, with Democratic voters in Iowa set to attend caucuses Monday evening.
