It’s time to take some profits on Tesla stock after its stunning rally, says New Street Research.

Tesla shares (ticker: TSLA) have been on quite a run. On Monday, the stock surged 20%, its largest percentage increase in one day since May 2013. The shares are now up 86% this year through Monday’s close and nearly 176% over the past year.

On Tuesday, New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu
lowered his rating for Tesla to Neutral from Buy, citing the prospect of three potential risks this year. He reaffirmed his $800 price target for Tesla stock.

“We see 2020 playing out fine, but it is largely expected, and we see some risks on the stock: end of the short squeeze, 1Q20 [2020 first quarter] miss on gross margins, Model Y launch disrupting Model 3 momentum,” he wrote. (A short squeeze is when investors who had bet on a price decline by selling the stock short rush to cover their bets, pushing up the stock.)

There are “limited sources of further appreciation in the next 12 months.”

Tesla shares closed up about 14% to $887.06 Tuesday. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

The analyst believes there are ways Tesla can add to its value through other businesses such as insurance, energy storage, and self-driving. However, he doesn’t expect these three areas to advance materially this year.

It’s “definitely not the end of the road [for Telsa]...Take partial profits and buy on next weakness,” he wrote.

Other Wall Street analysts are generally mixed on Tesla shares at these levels. Twenty-three percent have a Buy or Overweight rating on the company, while 45% have Sell ratings, according to FactSet.
