The stock of electric-vehicle maker Tesla is up nearly 80% for the year through Thursday, a surge that is lifting some exchange-traded funds and actively managed mutual funds that had the good fortune to own it.

For example, the $203 million First Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge Green Energy ETF (ticker: QCLN) has 13% of its assets in Tesla (TSLA), and is up 13% for the year. The VanEck Vectors Low Carbon Energy ETF (SMOG) has 14% of its assets in Tesla and is up 10% for the year.

But sometimes the results aren’t what you’d expect given the size of a fund’s Tesla position. The First Trust Nasdaq Global Auto ETF (CARZ) has 15% of its assets in Tesla, but is up only 3% for the year. That’s because the fund’s holdings in other auto makers have risen far less, or fallen. Toyota Motor (TM) is up around 2%, while Honda Motor (HMC) is down 6%. General Motors (GM) has declined 6% and the drop at the German auto maker Daimler (DAI.Germany) is 11%.

Without Tesla, the ETF’s performance would be far worse.

Among actively managed mutual funds, two Baron funds are notable beneficiaries of Tesla’s rise. Baron Partners (BPTRX), a growth fund that uses leverage to juice its returns, has 17% of its assets in Tesla and is up 19% for the year. The fund has around 27% leverage, meaning that it holds $1.27 of securities for every dollar investors have contributed. Baron Focused Growth (BFGFX) has around 14% its assets in Tesla, and is up 16% for the year.

American Funds’ $209 billion behemoth Growth Fund of America (AGTHX) owns 2.7% of Tesla, but that represented only around 1% of the fund’s assets as of the end of 2019. If the fund held all its Tesla shares, it’s certainly a bigger position now.

Growth Fund of America is up around 5% for the year. Assuming the fund didn’t sell any of its Tesla shares, it’s reasonable to think its advance could be responsible for nearly one percentage point of the fund’s 5% gain.

Passive investors—at least those in funds that track the S&P 500 —have missed out on Tesla’s surge because the stock isn’t in the index. The company hasn’t met the profit requirement for inclusion.

If the stock is included, index-tracking funds would have to buy the shares, potentially giving Tesla another lift.
