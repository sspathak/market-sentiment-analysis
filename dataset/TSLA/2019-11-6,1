Uber Technologies still looks like a money maker for patient investors.

The ride-sharing pioneer reported 30% revenue growth for the third quarter from a year earlier, but also a net loss of $1.16 billion according to GAAP metrics. With revenue on track to top $15 billion over the next 12 months, the stock is trading at less than four times sales. With that kind of top-line growth and with gross margins around 50%, I would expect this stock to trade closer to six times or eight times sales.

Uber UBER, -0.65%  has 104 million users worldwide, which means the $58 billion market cap values each user at $557. Compare that to Netflix NFLX, +0.31%  (which itself is 30% off its recent highs), for example, with 150 million users and a $128 billion market cap (six times this year’s sales), and you have a value of $847 for each user.

Let’s dig into why Uber is trading at what seems to be a discount to near-term fair market valuations while remaining a long-term opportunity. Here are some of the most important metrics from Uber’s quarterly report:

Revenue for Uber Eats, the company’s food delivery service, was up 64% year-over-year, clocking in at $645 million and up almost 10% quarter-over-quarter. Uber Freight grew 78% year-over-year, coming to $218 million for the quarter. Uber’s most established segment, rides, grew 19% year over year to $2.90 billion.

Uber reported $38 million in revenue for its Other Bets, which includes segments like its scooter business, compared to $3 million in the same quarter last year. Revenue for ATG and Other Technology Programs, which includes its self-driving car business, was $17 million, according to the release.

I wish the company would abandon its scooter business, which seems like a silly distraction and unlikely to be a meaningful contribution to revenue and earnings. I’m impressed that the Uber Freight is already pushing itself into a billion dollar-annualized revenue run rate. Amazon.com AMZN, +0.14%  and Uber can take a lot of market share from FedEx FDX, +1.86%, United Parcel Service UPS, +0.26%, postal services and trucking shipping companies in coming years. FexEx and UPS alone combine for $140 billion in annual sales.

The global ride-sharing/taxi business is growing steadily and will be a recurring revenue stream for Uber for many years to come. Uber’s global penetration is helping the company stave of competition somewhat, and Uber will likely have the balance sheet to control a fleet of self-driving cars, including Teslas TSLA, +8.21%, if Driverless ever becomes a true reality. That would mean competition will decrease and margins increase over time.

In the near term, the stock is still being tainted by its connection to SoftBank, and this week everybody’s worried about the lockup for insiders expiring. Both of these challenges are short-term and they create opportunities for long-term investors.

So while I’m pretty annoyed that Uber’s stock has gone down since I first bought it, I’m also thinking it’s probably a good time to buy more as the stock tumbles off this earnings report. I’m buying some more at $28 and below.
