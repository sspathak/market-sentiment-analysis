Three numbers to start your day:

The Shopping Season is Six Days Shorter This Year
—compared with last year. Thanksgiving came almost a full week later this year. So, that means today’s unofficial start of the holiday shopping season—known as Black Friday—is also happening later. And that could be bad news for retailers.

Retailers make most of their sales at the end of the year, and holiday shopping is a really important part of that.

But because this year’s holiday shopping season is almost a week shorter, people might just buy less. Retailers are already under financial pressure, and lower holiday sales would make it worse.

The Cost of Pre-ordering a Tesla Cybertruck is $100
Pre-ordering the truck means you basically have a reservation to actually buy it when it’s released. That means it is a lot cheaper to pre-order a Cybertruck than it was to pre-order the Model 3 before it came out. Back then, that set you back $1,000.

And orders for a Tesla sports car, known as the Tesla roadster? Those cost $50,000. In comparison, $100 doesn’t seem like much to lose if customers decide they want to cancel the purchase.

So while (TSLA) usually has a pretty good rate of conversions— meaning people who order and then actually buy a car—Wall Street still has some questions about what the actual demand for the Cybertruck will turn out to be.

Imports of Thanksgiving-related products Has Dropped 11.3% from a year ago.
That data covers the five months ending on October 31—the peak season for Thanksgiving imports. This time of the year, American consumers buy things like turkey fryers, seasonal crockery, and decorations. But a lot of those things are from China. in fact, last year, almost three-quarters of Thanksgiving were Chinese imports.

And so, you could say that one consequence of the U.S.-China trade war is fewer turkey fryers in American kitchens. Specifically, American imports of turkey fryers fell almost 14% from last year.
