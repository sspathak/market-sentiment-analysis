Electric vehicle pioneer Tesla is recalling 15,000 Model X SUVs, according to Reuters. But the stock isn’t moving on that bit of news.

Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA) is having another wild day of trading. Shares are up 4.7% in afternoon trading Thursday. Shares have fluctuated more than 6% intraday.

Investors can be forgiven for not focusing on the recall report. After all, automotive recalls happen from time to time. But the real reason they don’t seem to be paying it much mind is that there is simply too much else going on with Tesla today.

Tesla released its annual report Thursday. That’s an important event in and of itself. But the filing included news of a new Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena. Tesla also announced plans to sell about $2 billion worth of new stock to investors.

The recall is probably the third or fourth most important data point of the day.

The company delivered about 67,000 Model S and X vehicles in 2016. The recall applies to about 20% of that year’s volume. The problem is with steering assist motor bolts. Tesla will replace the bolts, and drivers can keep driving their vehicles while they wait for the fix.

Tesla investors are inured to daily volatility. Shares, for instance, have soared more than 85% year to date, crushing comparable gains of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial Average over the same span.
