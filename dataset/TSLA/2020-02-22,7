Momentum investors, who are relentlessly pushing up stocks, are oblivious to the breakout in gold amid a relatively rare event. Because of that, prudent investors should pay attention.

Let’s explore the issue with the help of a chart.

Chart
Please click here for an annotated chart of SPDR Gold Shares GLD, -0.36%, a gold exchange traded fund.

Note the following:

• The chart shows the previous resistance line, which has now become the support line.

• The chart shows a technical breakout in gold. This is a positive for gold but negative for stocks.

• The chart shows the breakout occurred after two shallow pullbacks. This is a positive for gold.

• The chart shows that the breakout is occurring on four rare things coming together.

• Gold is priced in dollars. For this reason, when the dollar rises, gold falls. Lately the dollar is becoming stronger, but gold is jumping instead of sinking.

• Typically gold goes down when the stock market goes up, especially if there is an aggressive increase in the stock market, as has been happening lately. However, gold has broken out as the stock market has ascended.

• Gold typically goes up when there is a new safe-haven event, such as war. Here, gold did not break out on the emergence of the coronavirus crisis. However, now that the coronavirus scare has been subsiding, gold is moving up. Gold breaking out under these circumstances is rare.

• The smart money (professionals) has not been buying gold until now, but it has jumped in with light buying. This behavior is rare, as the smart money typically buys on pullbacks.

• This breakout in gold is of major significance, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.55%  is in a strong uptrend and investors’ portfolios concentrated in mega-caps such as Apple AAPL, -0.75%, Amazon AMZN, +0.14%, Facebook FB, -1.42% and Alphabet GOOG, -0.63%   GOOGL, -0.69%.

• Semiconductors have been the leading indicators of the stock market. Investors should keep a careful watch on semiconductor stocks such as AMD AMD, -0.44%, Micron Technology MU, +0.21%, Nvidia NVDA, -0.68% and Intel INTC, -1.42%. Semiconductors are overbought and vulnerable.

• Investors should also keep an eye on short-squeezes in stocks such as Virgin Galactic SPCE, +2.20%, Tesla TSLA, +8.21%, Enphase ENPH, +4.32% and SolarEdge SEDG, +2.14%.

• There are new concerns about the coronavirus and its impact on earnings. Investors should stay tuned to the news from China as well as to earnings-related announcements.

What does it all mean?
Stay cautiously bullish on stocks and consider adding gold, silver and precious-metals stocks on pullbacks in the broader market.

Among ETFs, consider watching iShares Silver Trust SLV, -1.21%, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF GDX, -2.17% and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF GDXJ, -2.12%.
