Tesla delivered excellent fourth-quarter results. Then again, its shares have doubled over the past year and more than tripled from their 52-week low on June 3. This gives rise to fear that the stock has become dangerous.

But Jeff Reeves argues that Tesla TSLA, -2.72% may join the S&P 500 SPX, +0.17%  by the end of the year by meeting S&P Dow Jones Indicesâ€™ financial criteria. This will be a very important event, because the company, with its tremendous market value, will then be a major component of index funds holding hundreds of billions of dollars in assets, including the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, +0.21%. That will mean automatic support for the stock.
