Detroit -based auto maker General Motors reports fourth-quarter and full-year numbers before the market opens on Wednesday, Feb. 5.

The event caps a difficult year for the company on multiple fronts. Car sales fell in the U.S. and China. General Motors (ticker: GM) sales are expected to decline about 6% in 2019 compared with prior year. And there was a strike. The GM-United Auto Workers work stoppage, which ended in late October, was the company’s longest since 1970.

If that wasn’t enough, Tesla (TSLA) launched its Cybertruck, designed to win some share in the lucrative U.S. light truck market dominated by GM and Ford Motor (F).

Along with earnings, GM will give its outlook for 2020 on Wednesday. Investors are hoping for a better year. Here’s what to expect, along with some recent history.
