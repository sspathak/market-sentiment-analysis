Tesla Inc. TSLA, -2.72% has initiated a recall of Model X cars that were built before October 2016 to retrofit a power-steering component. "We have observed excessive corrosion on the bolts that attach this component to the steering gear in affected Model X vehicles," Tesla says on its website. "This corrosion has been observed primarily in very cold climates that use calcium or magnesium road salts rather than sodium chloride." Reuters, which first reported the recall Wednesday afternoon, said that fewer than 15,000 Model X units are affected by the voluntary recall. The recall pales in comparison to Tesla's 2018 recall of more than 120,000 Model S cars, which was due to a similar power-steering issue. Tesla shares declined about 2% in after-hours trading Wednesday, after closing with a 0.9% decline at $767.29.
