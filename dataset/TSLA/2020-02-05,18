Peloton Interactive stock slid below its $29 initial public offering price in after-hours trading on Wednesday—even though the connected fitness company beat earnings and revenue expectations in its fiscal second quarter.

Peloton’s (ticker: PTON) second-quarter net loss of 20 cents a share beat consensus estimates calling for a loss of 34 cents a share. Revenue of $466.3 million topped estimates calling for $423.7 million.

The company reached 712,005 connected fitness subscribers, up 96% year-over-year—and ahead of estimates calling for 688,000.

Average net monthly churn—a measure of people leaving the service—was down to 0.74%, better than estimates calling for 1.02%.

The company also raised its full-year fiscal 2020 outlook. It now expects to end the year with 920,000 to 930,000 connected fitness subscribers, and full-year revenue between $1.53 billion and $1.55 billion. But for the third quarter, it expects revenue between $470 million and $480 million, falling short of consensus expectations of $494 million.

Whether it is the third-quarter outlook, or hopes that Peloton would beat expectations more than it did, the highly-shorted stock was sinking just prior to the company’s 5 p.m. earnings call. Peloton stock was down 11% to $28.89 in aftermarket trading.

Barron’s highlighted the stock as a high-risk reward opportunity, given 80% of shares available for trading were sold short—which means selling borrowed shares in advance of an expected price decline. So shares could have surged if markets were happier with the results, forcing bearish investors to cover their short bets. Beyond Meat (BYND) and Tesla stock (TSLA) both jumped on such squeezes last year.

Options market activity before the results' release also signaled the stock would see a double-digit move on earnings. And boy was that accurate.
