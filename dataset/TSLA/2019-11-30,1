Back in 2011, with Tesla Inc. shares trading down around $22, CNBC’s “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer told a caller to “cut her losses” and unload her position. “Nothing there. Don’t like that stock,” he said.

Booyah! The stock closed Monday at $336.34.

While shares were busy proving that “sell” call profoundly wrong, Cramer has had plenty to say about Tesla TSLA, +8.21% and its boss, Elon Musk, along the way. Earlier this year, he said Musk is like P.T. Barnum and it’s “annoying.” Before that, he floated the idea of Musk being removed as CEO. More recently, he panned Tesla’s new Cybertruck as “a bit of a bust.”

Apparently something funny happened over the past couple of days: “I took a ride in a Tesla this weekend that made Lisa say, that’s it, we are buying one. Enough already,” he tweeted on Monday.


Cramer was referring to his wife, Lisa, and was clearly buying into the whole idea of “happy wife, happy life.” Now, he’s raising his price target on the stock.

He explained in a later tweet directed at Musk that the Model X is the version that he took for a spin and it was a “fantastic ride.”

When asked by a Musk fan if he thought more people would have the same change of heart if they took the time to drive one, Cramer donned his Wall Street cap. “I think if the balance sheet were better everyone would love it,” he said.

Still, the Tesla family was seemingly more than happy to have Jim Cramer aboard, and celebrated his glowing review with GIFs like this
