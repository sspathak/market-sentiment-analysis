Tesla can put on quite a show. The electric-vehicle pioneer revealed its so-called Cybertruck in Los Angeles Thursday evening. The event was a success with, perhaps, one small exception: The prototype’s ballistic glass windows broke. So who makes the glass anyway?

Before the secondary reveal, some more context. The test results surprised even Tesla (ticker: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. “Room for improvement,” joked Musk. “We even literally threw the kitchen sink at the glass….and it didn’t break.” That's one problem with live events.


The vehicle, however, passed a lot of other “tests” set up by Tesla. The Cybertruck won a tug of war with a Ford Motor (F) F-150. The stainless steel body panels withstood a sledgehammer. And the “Tesla Armor Glass” didn’t break when a ball bearing was dropped on it from quite a height. (Traditional windshield glass cracked under similar conditions.)

The glass is not supplied by Peru-based AGP Glass, which was Barron's first guess as the company supplies windshields for Tesla’s Model X and has a military-grade glass division. But AGP responded on Saturday to a request for comment and clarified that the company did not contribute in any way to the production of Cybertruck glass. PPG Industries (PPG) also has a glass franchise, but the company had told Barron’s on Friday that it isn't the supplier.

Trying to track down the supplier is one small example of how global the automotive supply chain is. It generates trillions in economic activity around the world each year.

Tesla stock is down more than $20, or 5.8%, in Friday trading, far worse than U.S. equity indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500. Truck-design disappointment could be a factor. But the stock has been on quite a run, rising about 50% over the past three months, far better than those same indexes. Better-than-expected third-quarter numbers catalyzed the recent stock rally.
