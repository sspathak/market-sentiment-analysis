The internet is going to hang onto this Tesla moment for a while.

The much anticipated, all-electric “Cybertruck” rolled across the stage late on Thursday to a cheering crowd. And while the angular, cold-rolled steel vehicle looked like it could pretty much survive anything, a steel ball managed to crack the windows during a demonstration to prove they were indeed shatterproof.

“Oh my f…g God,” said Tesla’s TSLA, +8.21%  Chief Executive Elon Musk, looking on as an assistant lobbed the ball, smashing the driver window as a smaller object shattered the one behind it. “It didn’t go through, that is the plus side…room for improvement.”


Musk said wrenches and even a kitchen sink thrown at the windows before that debut didn’t break them. “We’ll fix it in post,” he assured the crowd. Check out the YouTube video, minute 7:30 for a replay of the whole thing.
