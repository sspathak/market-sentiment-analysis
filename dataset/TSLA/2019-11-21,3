Tesla stock may be soaring into its pickup truck launch tonight—it’s gained 62% during the last three months—but one noted shortseller has said he remains short the company’s shares.

That would be Jim Chanos, founder of Kynikos Associates. In a video conversation with Hedgeye’s Keith McCullough, Chanos shot down rumors that he had covered his Tesla (ticker: TSLA) short.

“Tesla is and remains one of our biggest and our best short positions,” he said. “We’re still bears.”

Chanos says the stock has been in a range for five years. When the stock goes under $200, everyone says it’s going to going to go bust, Chanos says. When it hits $350, it’s “the market’s view on all of the future brilliant products that are going to come out of here at amazing margins.” Of which the pickup truck might just be one example.

According to Chanos, it’s just another car company, and if that’s the case, he says it’s probably worth zero based on auto industry valuation.

Tesla stock has gained 1.4% to $357.05 at 3:08 p.m. Thursday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 0.1% to 27,806.52.
