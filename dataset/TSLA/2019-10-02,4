Shares of Tesla fell in after-hours trading Wednesday after the electric-car maker reported third-quarter deliveries that disappointed investors.

Tesla stock (TSLA), which closed the regular session at $244.69, was recently off 4.8% to $231.45 after the company said it delivered 97,000 vehicles, including 79,600 Model 3s and a total of 17,400 of Models S and X, in the third quarter.

Wall Street was looking for a total of 99,000, according to FactSet’s survey of 11 analysts. Tesla distributed a document, incorporating 21 estimates, showing a lower consensus of 94,422 deliveries.

”Nearly all of our Model 3 orders were received from customers who did not previously hold a reservation, solidifying the transition to generating strong organic demand,” the company said in a statement. “We are continuing to focus on increasing production to meet that demand.”

The company delivered 95,356 vehicles in the second quarter, representing 77,634 Model 3s and 17,722 of the S and X combined.

In last year’s third quarter, the company delivered 83,774 vehicles, including 63,359 Model 3s and a combined 12,100 of its S and X models. Tesla records revenue when a buyer takes delivery of a vehicle.

Wall Street is looking for 106,000 deliveries in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet. The company has issued guidance to investors to expect 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries for the year, meaning it must deliver more than 105,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter to meet the low end of that range.

Tesla also said it produced 96,155 vehicles in the third quarter, compared with 87,048 in the second.

Tesla hasn’t announced a date for its third-quarter financial results. Wall Street is looking for a loss of 40 cents a share on revenue of $6.47 billion, according to FactSet.

CEO Elon Musk has said he was “pretty confident” the company would break even during the quarter.
