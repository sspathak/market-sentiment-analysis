The Wall Street Journal has noted Uber Technologies has closer ties with Saudi Arabia than any other Silicon Valley company.

After all, the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund invested $3.5 billion in Uber (ticker: UBER) three years ago for preferred stock and warrants that converted to 72.8 million Uber common shares when the ride-hailing company went public this year.

Public Investment Fund, or PIF, as Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund is known, has seen the value of its Uber stock investment fall by $1.1 billion to $2.4 billion as of Tuesday’s close at $32.53.

PIF didn’t respond to a request for comment on its Uber stock investment.

Interestingly, Uber stock was priced at $45 each for its initial public offering, which already devalued PIF’s investment by $222 million, Barron’s calculates. Uber had lowered its projected IPO price after Lyft stock (LYFT) struggled shortly after its public debut. Uber had contemplated a “maximum offering price” of $50 in an earlier registration form it had filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A $50 IPO price would have given PIF a $142 million gain on its Uber stock investment.

In its latest holdings report to the SEC, PIF noted that it continued to own 72.8 million Uber shares as of Sept. 30, and also 8.28 million Tesla (TSLA) shares. Tesla CEO Elon Musk last year thought he had a verbal agreement with PIF to take the electric-vehicle maker private, which led to a high-profile tweet that the SEC noticed.

In January of this year, though, PIF reportedly cut its exposure to Tesla stock through a hedging deal. If so, that was a savvy move; Tesla stock is down 23.2% through Tuesday’s close.
