A heightened fear of the coronavirus spread over the weekend amid reports of scores of new infections in Italy, pummeling U.S. stock indexes on Monday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJIA  fell 1,032 points, or 3.6%, to close at 27,960.80. The S&P 500 US:SPX  ended 3.4% lower and the Nasdaq Composite US:COMP  dropped 3.7%.

Travel-related and technology stocks were hit particularly hard.

The world’s integrated supply chains have investors worried about potential disruptions among companies based far away from the areas that have been hardest hit by the virus.

Many vulnerable people have lived in what Chris Dillon, T. Rowe Price’s investment specialist for global capital markets, calls “closed-habitat systems.” These aren’t limited to cruise lines, but include factories with dormitory housing for workers, such as Foxconn Technology TW:2354 US:FXCOF, which handles the final assembly of Apple’s US:AAPL  iPhones in China.

In an interview Feb. 21, Dillon said: “Foxconn has told its people not to go back” to some of the dormitories, which could hinder a return to normal assembly schedules.

Dillon said that while he and colleagues were “not understating the human tragedy,” it was important for investors to have perspective about the scale of the coronavirus. “Last year, 42 million people contracted the flu and 61,000 died” in the U.S. alone, he said.
