The Tennessee Department of Treasury made some big changes in its stock investments in the last quarter of 2019.

The department, which manages all of the state’s investments, including its pension fund, reduced investments in General Electric (ticker: GE), General Motors (GM) and Verizon Communications stock (VZ) in the fourth quarter. Tennessee’s treasury also bought more Walmart stock (WMT). The treasury disclosed the trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The state’s treasury department declined to comment on the stock trades.

GE stock surged 53.3% in 2019, trouncing the 28.9% rise in the S&P 500 index. Shares of the conglomerate are also rising in 2020, gaining 15.0% year to date through Friday’s close, compared with the 4.6% rise in the index.

Even some of GE stock’s biggest bears have changed their tune on the shares in the wake of the company’s strong fourth-quarter report.

Tennessee’s treasury department sold a net 462,411 GE shares in the quarter to end the year with 2.1 million GE shares.

The agency also sold 180,813 GM shares, lowering its investment to 392,150 shares.

GM stock eked out a 9.4% gain in 2019, and this year shares are down 5.0%. The auto giant’s stock is underperforming despite recently reporting strong earnings. We’ve also noted that GM has more in common with Tesla (TSLA) than meets the eye.

Verizon stock gained only 9.2% last year, and the shares are 4.7% in the red year to date. The communications giant’s fourth-quarter report in late January was disappointing, and at least one observer said the near-term picture for Verizon lacked catalysts.

Tennessee’s treasury sold 172,386 Verizon shares in the fourth quarter, lowering its investment to 1.8 million shares.

Walmart stock’s 27.6% rise in 2019 was just shy of the S&P 500’s gain, but this year the retailing giant’s shares are down 0.8%.

Walmart shuffled some executives soon after the holiday season, and the company is set to report fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday.

“Walmart should not have been immune to headwinds that drove disappointing Holiday results at Target (TGT) and other retailers,” Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman wrote in a Feb. 11 research report. Gutman rates Walmart stock at Overweight with a $130 price target, but notes that “[s]entiment skews negatively” into the earnings report.

Tennessee’s treasury bought an additional 325,018 Walmart shares in the quarter to end the year with 874,662 shares.
