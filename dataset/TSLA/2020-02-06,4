The Wuhan coronavirus is the classic black-swan event that almost no one anticipated and that everyone must confront. The stock market initially reacted badly, but now the virus has seemingly killed the black swan.

Still, investors must confront the widespread belief that the U.S. stock market is unstoppable and seemingly immune to black swans. Maybe it’s because interest rates are so low and investors feel not buying stocks is riskier than buying stocks. Or maybe it’s because President Donald Trump increasingly is seen as the stock market’s guardian.

If he wins a second term, as seems likely, many investors think stocks could benefit from his pro-market policies as the president dominates Washington in ways unseen since Lyndon Johnson’s presidency.

Ultimately, the perception of an all-powerful stock market becomes extremely dangerous, as it spreads apathy and greed, which are the personal black swans that haunt every investor and every portfolio.

Rather than suggesting that investors sell stocks, incurring capital gains, to buy call options—the standard options strategist’s answer to high stock prices and low volatility—it is better to focus on something rarely discussed: the discipline of taking profits. Many investors are sitting on loads of winning stock and options positions and few have a framework for handling gains.
