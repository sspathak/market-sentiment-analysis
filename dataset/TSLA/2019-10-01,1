Tesla TSLA, +9.23% apparently has some work to do with its latest “Smart Summon” autonomous driving software, which allows drivers to basically “summon” their cars from as far away as 200 feet.
But, in recent days, videos of Tesla owners trying out the feature have been shared across social media, and, as you can see, it didn’t always go as planned.
Tesla, for its part, warns on its website that drivers are “still responsible for your car and must monitor it and its surroundings at all times and be within your line of sight because it may not detect obstacles.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on these videos.

Tesla shares were down less than 1% in Monday trading
