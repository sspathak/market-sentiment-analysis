Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund, essentially liquidated its Tesla stock in the fourth quarter. That means that if the fund didn’t buy more this year, it has missed out on the remarkable rise in the shares of the electric-car maker.

The fund sold 8.2 million Tesla shares (ticker: TSLA) in the quarter ended Dec. 31, slashing its stake to 39,151 shares. Public Investment disclosed the sale in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday.

Tesla stock has caught fire as of late. One firm said that shares could reach $7,000, and as of Tuesday afternoon, Tesla stock had more than doubled to $904.94. The S&P 500 index has only tacked on 2% year to date.

Public Investment had been Tesla’s fourth-largest shareholder, according to S&P Capital IQ.

The fund didn’t respond to a request for comment on the stock sale.

According to the Wall Street Journal, a person familiar with the matter said in 2018 that Tesla’s founder, Elon Musk, thought he had a verbal agreement for Saudi Arabia to buy out Tesla when he made a tweet saying he had funding secured to take the company private. As is well known, that comment landed the CEO in hot water with the SEC.

On its site, Public Investment says it uses “standardized procedures and guidelines to govern investment decisions, focused on building a diversified portfolio which achieves attractive, risk-adjusted returns over the long-term.”

Public Investment also disclosed that it continues to own 72.8 million Uber Technologies (UBER) shares.
