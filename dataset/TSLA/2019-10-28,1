Earnings season is well under way. And thus far earnings themselves have been better than expected.

Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA) was a stand out, reporting a surprise profit and sending shares up more than 17% on Thursday. Twitter stock (TWTR), meanwhile, fell about 21% to $30.75 on Thursday, its largest decrease since Feb. 6, 2014, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Twitter blamed bugs related to its ability to target ads and share data, among other things, for a 15-cent earnings miss.

Out of 168 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings as of Thursday morning, 80.4% beat analyst expectations, compared with the average of 65% since 1994, according to Refinitiv.

On the flip side, companies have reported revenue beats about 62% of the time this season, pretty much in line with historical performance.

Next week, several heavy hitters will hope to raise that bar.

Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL) will help kick off next week’s earnings schedule on Monday. The tech giant has come under increased regulatory scrutiny, but shares have still gained in-line with the S&P 500 index in 2019 at 20%. Wall Street is calling for earnings of $12.28 a share on sales of $40.3 billion.

Apple stock (AAPL) has been on a tear this year, up 54% in 2019. Recent reports of higher-than-expected demand for its latest generation of iPhones paired with optimism about its growing service offerings, such as Apple Pay and Apple TV+, have fueled much of the gains. We’ll see if it continues on Wednesday, when the company reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. Wall Street’s consensus estimate is for earnings of $2.83 a share with sales of $259 billion.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was grilled by members of Congress earlier this week about plans for the digital currency Libra. But like with Alphabet, Wall Street hasn’t paid much mind to the regulatory concerns. Facebook shares (FB) have risen 42% in 2019. Wall Street’s consensus estimates call for earnings of $1.90 a share and sales of about $17.4 billion.

General Electric stock (GE) may be up 23% this year, but keep in mind it is down 21% in the trailing one-year period. As Barron’s noted earlier this week, investors will have a keen eye on cash flow, debt reduction, and any “hidden” debt from legacy insurance liabilities in GE’s Oct. 30 earnings report. Wall Street is calling for earnings of 12 cents a share with sales of $28.9 billion.


Exxon Mobil earnings have been dragged by spending on projects in the Permian Basin and abroad, but a report from Goldman Sachs said earlier this month earnings for the entire energy sector should bounce back in 2020. Exxon Mobil stock (XOM) is up 1.3% in 2019, but down 12% in the trailing one-year period. For third quarter 2019, Wall Street estimates earnings of 67 cents a share on sales of $60.9 billion.
