Three numbers to start your day:

The First Frozen Movie Brought in $1.3 Billion
—at the box office. Now, Frozen 2 debuts in theaters on Friday and it’s expected to be another blowout hit. Analysts think the movie will bring in as much as 130 million dollars in its first weekend.

If the film is the success many expect it to be, it will be another boost to Disney (DIS) stock. Last week, the company’s streaming service Disney+ made its debut, and Disney’s shares surged as more than 10 million people signed up for the service.

Target Stock Rose 14% on Wednesday
You might remember that there was a retail rout when both Kohl’s (KSS) and Home Depot (HD) reported disappointing earnings earlier this week. Target (TGT) bucked that trend, not only topping earnings estimates, but increasing its guidance for the year. Another home retailer, Lowe’s, also delivered strong results.

Still, those retail wins didn’t do much to help shares in L Brands (LB) and Nordstrom Inc. (JVN). They both continued to slide downward.

Every Year, Three Million Pickup Trucks are Sold in the U.S.
And today, Tesla (TSLA) is getting into the truck business. The electric vehicle pioneer is introducing what it has somewhat bafflingly called a “Cyberpunk” pickup truck. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said investors should think of Blade Runner when imagining the soon-to-be-unveiled truck’s design.

The look of the new vehicle is far from the only unknown. It’s unclear exactly what part of the market Tesla will try to capture. More than half of trucks sold are parts of commercial fleets, but there’s also a booming market for fancy pickups that are bought by people who don’t haul or tow anything. While there are lots of paths Tesla could take, it’s probably a good bet to expect more hype than clarity from CEO Musk.
