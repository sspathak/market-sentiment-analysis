What do celebrities Sacha Baron Cohen, Stephen King and Mark Hamill all have in common, besides a shared disdain for Donald Trump?

Facebook FB, +0.33%. They all have real problems with Facebook.

Cohen has been at it for awhile. Last month he lit up the Facebook founder by telling him in a tweet that “history will judge you harshly — if we still have historians after you help destroy democracy!” Before that, he called Facebook, along with Twitter TWTR, +1.20% and Google GOOG, +1.66%, “the greatest propaganda machine in history.”

Facebook did not respond to a request for comment after Cohen’s remarks.

As for Musk, he’s also long been a critic. He deleted his companies’ official Facebook pages in 2018 following the whole Cambridge Analytica controversy. “What’s Facebook?” he said back then.

Meanwhile, Musk continues to enjoy the torrid rally in Tesla’s share price. The stock again topped $800 a share early in Monday’s trading session and has more than doubled in the past three months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.20% and S&P 500 index SPX, +0.17% were logging gains as well. Tesla shares are still below their intraday high of $968.99 from earlier this month.
