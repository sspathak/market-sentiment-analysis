U.S. auto maker Ford Motor reports fourth-quarter and full-year earnings after the market closes today.

The event caps a difficult year for the company. Car sales fell in the U.S. and China and sales for Ford (ticker: F) are expected to have declined about 3% year over year in 2019.

If that wasnâ€™t enough, Tesla (TSLA) introduced its Cybertruck, designed to win some share in the lucrative U.S. light-truck market dominated by Ford and General Motors (GM).

Along with earnings, Ford should give its outlook for 2020. Investors are hoping for a better year. Here is what to expect, along with some recent history.


Management has scheduled an earnings conference call for 5 p.m. Eastern time to review results and talk about the coming year.
