Tesla’s spectacular rally so far this year has powered the $240 billion U.S. convertible-securities market, where the electric-car company is the largest issuer with a roughly 5% weighting.

The SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Convertible Securities exchange-traded fund (ticker: CWB) is up 6% this year, double the advance in the S&P 500 index. The Tesla (TSLA) convertible securities account for an estimated one-third or more of the ETF’s gain.

The $4.8 billion SPDR convertible ETF was down 28 cents to $58.76 Wednesday as Tesla stock fell sharply following its surge on Monday and Tuesday. The shares slid $105.50, or 12%, to $781.52 by midday, although the stock remained up 86% so far this year.


Tesla has three large convertible-bond issues outstanding: a 2.375% security due in 2022; a 2% issue, due in 2024; and a 1.25% issue due in 2021.

With the run-up in Tesla shares, the converts are trading at big premiums to their face value of 100 and amount to surrogates for the equity.

The largest, the 2% bond, has a face value of $1.8 billion and was issued last May. It finished Tuesday at a record $294, according to Bloomberg data. The issue is down $32 Wednesday, at $262, an 11% drop, reflecting the decline in Tesla stock.

These bonds are up from a price of $150 at the end of last year and from about $100 when they were sold last year. This issue converts into 3.2 Tesla shares for each $1,000 bond and now is valued at more than $5 billion based on the run-up in the stock.

Converts are hybrids that offer the upside of stocks and the downside protection of bonds or preferred stock. They tend to have less upside than the underlying shares but better downside protection. The Tesla converts held up better than the stock when the shares were weak last year, but with the surge in Tesla stock, they closely match movements in the stock.

Tesla’s weighting in the convertible indexes and the volatility of the stock mean the bonds will continue to have a meaningful impact.
