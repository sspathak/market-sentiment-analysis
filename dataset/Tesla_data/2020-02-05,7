Shares of Tesla Inc. tsla dropped 6.4% in premarket trading Wednesday, which puts them on track to snap an epic six-session win streak in which prices soared 59%, and the electric vehicle maker's market capitalization swelled by more than $59 billion. Wall Street analysts haven't quite caught up with the stock's rally. Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer downgraded the stock to hold from buy and reiterated his $750 stock price target, which was 15.5% below Tuesday's record close of $887.06, and he cut his rating to hold from buy. In all, no less than 12 of the 31 analysts surveyed by FactSet have raised their price targets during the win streak, but the average price target was still just $496.71, or 44% below Tuesday's closing price. Meanwhile, Wedbush's Dan Ives reiterated his $1,000 stock price target, saying reports that China deliveries will be temporarily delayed because of the coronavirus outbreak was just a "small speed bump." Tesla's stock has more than doubled (up 112.1%) in 2020 through Tuesday, while the S&P 500 spx has edged up 2.1%.
