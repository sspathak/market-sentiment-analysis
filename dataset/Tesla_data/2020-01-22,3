Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.34% shot up 4.6% toward a record high in morning trading Wednesday, enough to lift the electric car maker's market capitalization above $100 billion. That should make Chief Executive Elon Musk pretty happy, as his compensation package includes performance milestones for market-cap thresholds, starting at $100 billion. The stock is now trading well above the Tuesday's record close of $547.20, and the all-time intraday high of $548.58. The market cap has swelled to $103.2 billion. Helping give Tesla's stock a boost on Wednesday was a price target increase by Wedbush analyst Dan Ives and a Bloomberg report that the company settled a lawsuit that paves the way for it to open service centers in Michigan. The stock has more than doubled (up 124.0%) over the past three months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.54% has gained 9.4%.
