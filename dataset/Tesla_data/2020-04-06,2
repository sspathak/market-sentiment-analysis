Tesla Inc.'s stock TSLA, +4.21% has not priced in the impact on demand of a global recession, which could hurt its business for several quarters or longer, Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote Monday. It took about five years for peer auto sales to recover from the 2008 recession, Kallo wrote in a note to clients. "That said, we do think TSLA could fare better than luxury peers, with new products/geographies driving growth, a potentially widening EV competitive advantage, and OTA updates keeping vehicles fresh," the analyst wrote. Model 3 comps reached peak U.S. sales in 2007 but then fell about 31% during the crisis and only hit a trough in 2009, he wrote. It was another roughly six years before recovering to pre-recession highs. "Similarly, U.S. auto SAAR took 5-6 years to recover to pre-recession levels after declining ~35% between 2007 and 2009," said the note. {"While the 2008 downturn was clearly an outlier historically, if the duration of recoveries is similar we think there could be an overhang on demand." Kallo rates the stock as neutral with a $525 price target. Tesla shares were up 6.5% premarket and have gained about 15% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.28% has fallen 23%.
