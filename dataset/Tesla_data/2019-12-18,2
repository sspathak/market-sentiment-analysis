Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.82% may be prepared to cut prices of its Model-3 sedans, due to be built in China, in a bid to attract more buyers, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing sources. The electric-car maker will likely lower the sedan price -- set to start at 355,800 yuan ($50,800) -- by 20% or more by mid-2020, those sources said. The company plans to make the price cuts possible by sourcing components locally. A China Tesla representative declined to comment to Bloomberg.
