“ ‘We thought he was getting things wrong. I feel more comfortable now.’ ”That’s James Anderson, the head of global equities for Scottish investment giant Baillie Gifford, explaining to the Financial Times why Tesla’s biggest institutional shareholder is feeling more bullish about where the electric-car company goes from here. Tesla TSLA, +4.35%, Anderson said, is a “better run” company after its regulatory battles following the recent addition of independent directors to oversee CEO Elon Musk.Those additions include Oracle’s ORCL, +0.85% Larry Ellison as well as James Murdoch, the son News Corp founder NWS, +0.62% Rupert Murdoch. Specifically, Anderson pointed to the appointment of Robyn Denholm as chairwoman as having provided Musk “emotional” support and allowed him to focus on leading the company, rather than such distractions as Tesla’s more vocal detractors. “I think that the shorts acquire too much publicity,” Anderson told the FT ahead of his planned trip to California to speak with Tesla executives.Baillie Gifford first bought shares in Tesla back in 2013 and has built that up to a 7.5% stake that’s now worth more than $9 billion. That stake, however, took a big hit on Monday along with the broader market. Tesla shares were down almost 10% in midday trades, while the Dow DJIA, +0.62% had shed more than 2,000 points at its low point.
