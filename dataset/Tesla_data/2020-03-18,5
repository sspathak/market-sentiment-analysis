Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.30% told some employees at its factory in Fremont, Calif., to continue to come to work, the San Jose Mercury News reported Wednesday, citing an email from Tesla management it said it obtained. Late Tuesday, officials in Alameda County, one of seven San Francisco Bay area counties under a "shelter in place" order, deemed the Tesla factory a non-essential business that would only maintain "minimum basic operations" amid the regional lockdown. The newspaper said that the memo cited "conflicting guidance" from different levels of government about what it could operate. Tesla is continuing to operate with only "essential employees" at the factory, and other employees are working from home, the newspaper reported. Tesla has not responded to requests for comment. The shares have dropped 17% on Wednesday amid another U.S. equities carnage, holding on to gains around 30% for the past 12 months. Those 12-month gains contrast with losses around 18% for the S&P 500 index. SPX, +0.26%. CNBC reported earlier Tuesday that General Motors Co. GM, -0.68%, Ford Motor Co. F, +0.43% and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCAU, +0.34% were planning to close their U.S. auto factories amid nationwide efforts to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic.
