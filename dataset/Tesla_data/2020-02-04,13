With Tesla Inc.'s stock TSLA, +4.48% surging 13%, the electric car maker's market capitalization has climbed to about $158.2 billion, which isn't far from doubling the combined market caps of rivals General Motors Co. GM, -0.41% of $49.2 billion and Ford Motor Co. F, +0.32% of $36.2 billion. Throw in Fiat Chyrsler Automobiles N.V.'s FCAU, +0.34% market cap of $26.3 billion, and all three automakers can fit inside Tesla, with room to spare. However, Tesla is still well short of Toyota Motor Corp.'s TM, +0.57% market cap, which is currently at $233.5 billion. Tesla is not in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.17%, but it would be the 38th largest in the index. Tesla currently sits just below FAANG member Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.07% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.52% member Nike Inc. NKE, +1.11%, which are both at $159.4 billion.
