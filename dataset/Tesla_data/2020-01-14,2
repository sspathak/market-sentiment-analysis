Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.32% surged 3.1% toward yet another record in premarket trading Tuesday, after Deutsche Bank's Emmanuel Rosner became the latest analyst to boost their price target, citing an improved global auto market, highlighted by potential strength in China, although his new target remained well below current prices. Rosner reiterated his hold rating, but lifted his target to $455, which was 13% below Monday's closing price of $524.86, from $290. No less than 13 of the 32 analysts that contribute estimates to FactSet have raised their targets in January, lifting the average to $375.01--29% below Monday's close--from $334.07 at the end of December. Following a 6% decline in global auto production in 2019, he expects production to be down just 1% in 2020. "Europe volume and mix constitute the largest potential headwinds for the group this year, followed by commercial vehicles," Rosner wrote in a note to clients. "Conversely, we believe China auto demand could offer potential upside risk versus our base case." Tesla's stock has already soared 25.5% this month, reaching 5 record closes. It has more than doubled (up 104.3%) over the past three months, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.20% has gained 10.9%.
