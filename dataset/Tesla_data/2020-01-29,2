Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.37% Chief Executive Elon Musk said Wednesday that his company will have no trouble selling as many Cybertrucks "as we can make ... It's going to be pretty nuts." Musk renewed his promise that the "bad ass" pickup truck is something out of a "sci-fi movie set." The Cybertruck got no mentions in Tesla's fourth-quarter letter to investors, and Musk did not provide details about its production. The vehicle "is better than people realize," the CEO said. Tesla revealed the angular pickup truck in November. Later in the conference call, Musk dodged a question about how many Cybertrucks the company is aiming to make.
