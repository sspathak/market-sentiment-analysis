Shares of Tesla Inc. took a dive Monday, to extend their pullback from last week’s record close, after Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said he expects 2019 vehicle deliveries to come in below the low end of the electric vehicle maker’s guidance range.Osborne raised his fourth-quarter vehicle delivery estimate to 101,000 from 95,000, citing strength in China and the Netherlands, ahead of reduced subsidies next year. Despite the increase, he expects the 2019 delivery total to be about 356,000 vehicles, “slightly missing” projections of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles.He said subsidy changes continue to be the biggest driver of market adoption of Tesla’s products.“Despite commentary earlier this year suggesting a smoothing of deliveries through the quarter, Tesla appears to continue to stress its logistics for end of quarter surges,” Osborne wrote in a note to clients.The stock TSLA, +4.74%  fell as much as 4.9% to an intraday low of $409.26, before paring losses to close down 3.6% at $414.70. Trading volume was 12.6 million shares, above the full-day average of about 8.9 million shares.Osborne now expects 15,000 Model S and Model X deliveries during the fourth quarter, which is below management-provided estimate of 20,000, while his Model 3 delivery estimate of 85,300 vehicles is roughly in line with expectations of 85,500.Excluding deliveries in China and the Netherlands, Osborne said he expects fourth-quarter Model 3 deliveries to be down 9% from the third quarter, and down 7% from a year ago. He said the decline “highlights the demand saturation we are seeing across most mature markets as we shift from pent-up demand to steady flow demand.”Osborne’s call comes as Tesla made its first deliveries of cars built at its Gigafactory 3 plant in China on Monday.

Despite the increase, that new target was 49.4% below Monday’s closing price.The stock fell for a second day, after snapping a six-day win streak that was capped by the Dec. 26 record close of $430.94.
