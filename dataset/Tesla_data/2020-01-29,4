Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.34% Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn said Wednesday that the Silicon Valley car maker is expecting "a one to one-and-a-half week delay in the ramp of Shanghai-built Model 3 due to a government-required factory shutdown" related to the deadly coronavirus. "This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages," he said in a call with analysts post the company's results. "We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont," but are so far not aware of anything material, Kirkhorn said.
