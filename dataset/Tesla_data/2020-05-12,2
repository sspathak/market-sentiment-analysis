President Donald Trump took sides with Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk on Tuesday, tweeting support for reopening the car maker’s sole U.S. car-making facility as the company clashed with local health authorities. Tesla TSLA, +0.95%  on Monday reopened its Fremont, Calif., plant beyond minimal operations, after CEO Musk vowed to resume production against regulations in Alameda County. “If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me,” Musk said on Twitter. The plant and other businesses considered nonessential are under a regional shutdown order to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning that the plant should be allowed to open “NOW.” “It can be done Fast & Safely,” the president said. Trump’s comment followed a similar statement by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday. As MarketWatch reported, county health authorities said in a statement late Monday they have learned the Tesla plant has reopened beyond basic maintenance, and that they have notified Tesla it could only maintain minimal operations until an approved plan is in place.It was unclear whether Tesla would suffer any consequences for reopening without a plan in place.Claudia Assis contributed to this story.
