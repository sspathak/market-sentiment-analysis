Tesla Inc. TSLA, +0.95% has told employees they could have their unemployment benefits suspended if they don't return to work, according to a report on The Guardian that cited emails reviewed by the publication. Workers who would not feel comfortable returning amid the pandemic were told they would be on unpaid leave, and choosing not to report could cut or reduce unemployment benefits depending on the worker's location, the report said. One Tesla worker told The Guardian that the email came across as intimidation, saying they and others are waiting for a regional shelter-in-place order to be lifted in order to return to work. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from The Guardian. The company on Mondayreopened its car-making factory in Fremont, Calif., despite the regional shutdown order to curb the spread of the coronavirus in effect through May. Health officials in Alameda County, where the plant is located, said Tuesday they are reviewing Tesla's safety plan for the reopening of the plant.
