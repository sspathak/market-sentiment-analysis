AAPL, -0.56% eroded some of the optimism that helped the Dow and S&P ring up their best April gains in 82 years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.83% was off 630 points, or 2.6%, at 23,720; the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.88% fell 89 points, or 3%, at 2,824, while the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.70% declined 3.5% at 8,577. Late Thursday, Amazon said coronavirus-related costs such as employee testing and higher wages added to expenses and would likely in the future. Meanwhile, Apple declined to provide guidance for the current quarter. Adding to the bearish tone, President Trump indicated he may consider imposing tariffs on China, for their role in handling the novel coronavirus outbreak, which was first identified in Wuhan, China. Separately, shares of Tesla were under pressure after the CEO of the electric-vehicle maker, Elon Musk, tweeted that the company's share price was too high.
