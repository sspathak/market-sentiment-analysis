It’s getting harder and harder to be a Tesla Inc. short seller. Tesla TSLA, +4.44%  stock’s 20% rally resulted in paper losses of about $2.5 billion on Monday alone for short sellers, S3 Analytics said in a note. Tesla set a record close of $780 and an intraday record high of $786.14 on Monday, and the 20% rally was the stock’s largest one-day percentage increase since May 9, 2013, when it rose 24.4%. That was a day after Tesla posted its first-ever quarterly profit. “Everyone is anticipating a dramatic (Tesla) short squeeze, but it is more likely to be a continuous slow decline in shares shorted rather than a sudden abrupt plunge,” said S3, a financial technology and analytics firm. That’s because of different types of hedging, the analysts said. “While we are seeing some momentum short sellers increasing their positions in anticipation of a short-term pullback, we should see an increase of short-covering due to this $700/share level squeeze,” they said.
