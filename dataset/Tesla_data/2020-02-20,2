BERLIN — A German court on Thursday overturned an injunction that has halted Tesla Inc.’s preliminary work to prepare to build its first European plant on the outskirts of Berlin, defeating a move by local environmentalists to stop Tesla from clearing a patch of forest. The decision by the Berlin Brandenburg Administrative Court means Tesla TSLA, +4.07%   will be allowed to clear trees on the site before the end of the month, which is when environmental law would prohibit cutting down the trees during nesting and mating season for local wildlife. A delay would have made it difficult for Tesla to keep an ambitious schedule to begin producing cars at the plant by summer 2021. The court’s decision is final and cannot be appealed.
