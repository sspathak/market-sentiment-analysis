Tesla Inc.'s tsla Smart Summon feature that was recently launched on its Model 3 is glitchy and works intermittently without an obvious benefit, Consumer Reports said Wednesday. The publication made the comment after tests conducted over several days at a Connecticut testing center and nearby parking lots. Tesla has said in online marketing materials and public comments from its chief executive Elon Musk, that owners can use a smartphone to summon their vehicles to pick them up, to avoid walking across a parking lot with groceries during rain, for example. While the Model 3 manual warns of limitations on the service, some owners have reported minor fender benders using the feature in parking lots at low speeds, said Consumer Reports. Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing, said consumers are being used at beta-testers to fine-tune the technology, even though they are paying $6,000 upfront for it. "What consumers are really getting is the chance to participate in a kind of science experiment," he said. "This is a work in progress." Tesla did not return calls from Consumer Reports seeking comment. Shares were up 0.9% premarket, but have fallen 28% in 2019, while the S&P 500 spx has gained 15%.
