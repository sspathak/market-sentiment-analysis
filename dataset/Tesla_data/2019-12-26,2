Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.75% confirmed in a filing Thursday afternoon that it has secured local loans in China for its "Gigafactory" in the country. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla disclosed that it had agreed to a secured term loan facility of up to 9 billion yuan -- roughly $1.3 billion -- and an unsecured revolving loan facility of up to 2.25 billion yuan with local Chinese lenders. Tesla used parts of the proceeds to pay off a bridge loan of up to 3.5 billion yuan, which was then terminated. Tesla has built a new factory in China and intends to build its electric cars for the Asian market at the new facility. Reuters reported earlier this week that Tesla had secured a 10-billion-yuan loan in China. Tesla's stock has roared to record highs this month, and gained another 1.3% Thursday to close at $430.94.
