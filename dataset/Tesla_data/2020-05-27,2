Tesla Inc.'s TSLA, +0.95% stock price target was raised by 33% by Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who said the electric vehicle maker appears to be "turning the corner" from both a demand and production perspective heading into June. The stock slipped 0.1% in premarket trading, as the price target still implies a discount. Ives raised his target to $800, which is 2.3% below Tuesday's closing price of $818.87, while reiterating the neutral rating he's had on Tesla for the past 13 months. "While Tesla (and every other auto manufacturer) is navigating this unprecedented COVID-19 environment, the company took a major step forward around fulfilling demand and production concerns with the Fremont artery now up and running after the Musk vs. Alameda County stand-off got resolved," Ives said. "While 2Q delivery numbers remain in flux due to a host of logistical issues as well as overall lockdown conditions now starting to ease across the US and Europe, it appears underlying demand for Model 3 in China is strong with a solid May and June likely in the cards and clear momentum heading into 2H." The stock has nearly doubled (up 95.8%) year to date through Tuesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.88% has lost 7.4%.
