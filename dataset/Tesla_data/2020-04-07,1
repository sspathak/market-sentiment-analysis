Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.16% will cut salaries and furlough non-essential workers at its U.S. facilities until they are able to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic, the tech news site Protocol reported Tuesday night. According to an internal email obtained by Protocol, furloughs will begin Monday, with the goal of ending May 4 if factories reopen then as scheduled. Salaried employees will see temporary 10% pay cuts, while directors' pay will be cut 20% and executives at the level of vice president and above will see 30% cuts, Protocol reported. Tesla announced in late March that it would temporarily shut its Fremont auto factory and Buffalo, N.Y., solar-panel factory to limit the spread of COVID-19, and last week sharply scaled back operations at its Nevada gigafactory. The Buffalo plant may soon reopen to manufacture ventilator components.
