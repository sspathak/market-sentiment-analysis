Tesla Inc. tsla Chief Executive Elon Musk reiterated his criticism of ongoing shelter-in-place orders across the U.S., calling it an "infringement of people's rights" and saying that telling people they cannot leave their homes is "fascist, this is not democratic. Give people back their (expletive) freedom." Tesla's sole U.S. vehicle-producing factory in Fremont, Calif., has been shuttered since late March as the San Francisco Bay Area was among the first regions in the U.S. to issue mandatory shutdowns. "It's outrage" that will cause "great harm" not just to Tesla but other companies and suppliers, Musk said in a call with analysts late Wednesday. While many will weather the storm, there are many small companies that will not, Musk said. Tesla earlier Wednesday reported a surprise first-quarter profit, sending the stock soaring in the extended session.
