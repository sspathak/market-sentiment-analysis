Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.37% said via Twitter on Monday that the deliveries of the Model Y, its compact SUV, have started, without giving further details. Production of the Model Y started in late July at Tesla's California plant. In October, Chief Executive Elon Musk said he expected the Model Y to outsell the Model 3 mass-market sedan, the Model X luxury sedan, and the SUV Model X combined. The Model Y is Tesla's stab at the growing small-SUV segment, one of the auto industry's top-selling body styles. Tesla did not immediately return a request for additional information about the Model Y deliveries. The stock, which topped $800 last month, traded around $467 on Monday, off 14% for the day. Tesla shares are holding on to 70% gains in the past 12 months, versus declines of 24% and 26% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.26% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.59%.
