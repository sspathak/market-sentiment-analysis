Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.74% sank 4.2% in active morning trading Monday, after Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said he expects the electric vehicle maker's full-year delivery total to be below the low end of guidance, amid disappointing Model S/X results. Although Osborne raised his fourth-quarter delivery estimate to 101,000 from 95,000, to reflect strength in the Netherlands and China ahead of subsidy reductions, he said he believes the 2019 delivery total will be about 356,000 vehicles, "slightly missing" the guidance range of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles. For the fourth quarter, Osborne expects 15,000 Model S/X deliveries, below guidance of 20,000, while his estimate of 85,300 Model 3 estimate is in line with expectations of 85,500. Excluding the Netherlands and China, Osborne projects fourth-quarter Model 3 deliveries to be down 7% from a year ago, "which highlights the demand saturation we are seeing across most mature markets as we shift from pent-up demand to steady flow demand," Osborne wrote in a note to clients. He reiterated his underperform rating but raised his price target to $210, which is 49% below current levels, from $190. The stock has run up 24% year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.21% has climbed 28%.
