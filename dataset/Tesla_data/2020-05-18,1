Tesla Inc. TSLA, +0.95% will raise the price of the "full self-driving" option on its electric vehicles worldwide by $1,000 starting July 1, Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted late Monday. Currently, the feature costs $7,000. "The FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval," Musk said in a follow-up tweet. "[At] that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000." Despite its name, "full self-driving" is not a fully autonomous-driving feature, but rather works with Tesla's Autopilot to provide enhanced driver assistance.
