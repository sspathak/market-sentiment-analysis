Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.23% fell in the extended session Monday after San Francisco Bay Area authorities extended the regional shelter-in-place orders through the end of May, quashing hopes that Tesla's Fremont, Calif., factory would restart soon. Tesla stock ended the regular Monday session up 10% on a report that the factory, Tesla's only U.S. car-making plant, was readying a resumption of operations as the Bay Area's shutdown orders were due to expire next week. CNBC reported late Monday such plans were abandoned with the extension of the regional shelter-in-place order. Tesla and local authorities had sparred over the factory, which was not considered essential and shut down in late March.
