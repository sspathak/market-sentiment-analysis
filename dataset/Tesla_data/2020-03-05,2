Shares of Tesla Inc. tsla dropped 3.4% in premarket trading Thursday, after automaker General Motors Co. gm said it plans to go all in on electric vehicles, with plans spend $20 billion over the next five years to support the business, including ways to lower battery costs. The decline puts the stock on track to snap a 3-day win streak in which it rose 12.2%. "While arguably it can be expected that Tesla is in at least as good a position to benefit from the lower battery costs that GM looks forward to, we nevertheless see a negative read from GM's targeting 1 million [battery electric vehicle] sales per year (between North America and China) by the middle of the decade, adding to other automakers such as Volkswagen and even Mercedes which are targeting lofty BEV sales and production figures," J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note to clients. Wedbush's Daniel Ives said he believes GM's EV event was "a clear shot across the bow" against Tesla and Chief Executive Elon Musk, but Ives said Tesla continues to "lead the EV landscape by a clear margin." He said, however, that given GM's vast distribution and global customer base, the legacy automaker "must be taken seriously in this EV arms race." Tesla's stock has more than doubled (up 127%) over the past three months, while GM shares have tumbled 12% and the S&P 500 spx has inched up 0.4%.
