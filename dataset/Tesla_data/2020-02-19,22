Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.20% netted $2.31 billion in its recent stock offering, the company said in a filing late Wednesday. The company sold 2.65 million shares and the deal's underwriters exercised in full the option to buy another 397,500 shares, Tesla said. Tesla jolted markets last week in announcing the share offering and also a previously undisclosed SEC probe. The offer priced on Friday at $767 a share. Tesla shares ended 6.9% higher on Wednesday thanks in part to a price-target increase by analysts at Piper.
