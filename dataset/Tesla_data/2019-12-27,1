U.S. stock benchmarks on Friday closed out a holiday-shortened week modestly lower, as the main indexes lost steam at the end of a stretch that has mostly seen investors scoop up risky assets with just two trading sessions remaining in 2019. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP snapped an 11-day streak, finishing down 0.2%, at 9,006, holing above a psychologically significant level at 9000, which it broke above for the first time on Thursday. The technology-laden index had produced 11 straight gains and 10 consecutive record finishes before Friday's close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA finished slightly higher at 28,645, marking a fresh record, while the S&P 500 index SPX ended the session virtually unchanged at 3,240 (and could notch a record if it settles in the green. All closing levels are on a preliminary basis). All three benchmarks ended Thursday trade at all-time highs and have produced healthy weekly gains. For the week, the Nasdaq logged a 0.9% gain, the S&P 500 closed up 0.6% and the Dow gained 0.7% on the week. In corporate news, shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA finished slightly lower, down 0.1%, even as the electric-car maker said it was set to deliver China-made Model 3 cars starting on Monday. Separately, shares of Michaels Cos. MIK surged 33% after the arts-and-crafts retailer said it was hiring Ashley Buchanan, a top e-commerce executive from Walmart Inc. WMT to become its president and CEO. Markets will see another abbreviated session next week, with markets closed for the New Year on Wednesday.
