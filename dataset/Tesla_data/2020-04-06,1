Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois upgraded Tesla Inc.'s stock TSLA, +4.20% to buy from hold on Monday, writing that while low gas prices could be a headwind to customer demand in the near term, he's encouraged by "continued public policy commitment to supporting [electric-vehicle] sales" in Europe and China. Houchois also argued that Tesla's balance sheet should remain in "solid shape" despite disruptions to the company's inventories and receivables at the end of the first quarter due to the COVID-19 outbreak. "Looking further out, we see Tesla's ability to attract capital as a strong positive as pressure on the industry's transformation accelerates," he wrote. Houchois lowered his price target to $650 from $800 in conjunction with the upgrade. Tesla shares are up 5% in premarket trading Monday. The stock has lost 32% over the past month, as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.28% has fallen 16%.
