Shares of Nio Inc. NIO, -3.16% slipped 0.3% in morning trading Friday, after Goldman Sachs analyst Fei Fang backed away from his bullish stance on the China-based electric car maker, citing concerns over sales volumes and potential share dilution. The stock has had a volatile start Friday, as it has traded down as much as 4.9% and up as much as 3.0% intraday. Fang cut his rating to neutral, after being at buy for the past seven months, while slashing his stock price target by 85%, to $1.47 from $9.76. While Nio's sales volumes have outperformed U.S. rival Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.92% and BYD Tang since China's government cut electric-vehicle (EV) subsidies in June, Nio's third-quarter guidance implies a 423-unit, month-on-month decline in volume in September, and the fourth-quarter outlook remains "clouded." And given the outlook for continued negative free cash flow, Nio's funding pattern suggests a preference for continued use of equity, which would result in significant share count dilution," Fang wrote. The stock has soared 24% since closing at a record low of $1.32 on Oct. 1,which followed a 57% plunge amid an 8-session losing streak. The stock has shed 74% year to date, while Tesla's stock has dropped 31% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.17% has gained 17%.
