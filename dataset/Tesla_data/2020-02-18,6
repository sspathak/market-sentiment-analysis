The purchases would have come as Tesla’s shares TSLA, +4.27% were zooming higher, punishing a number of investors with short positions who had bet that the Elon Musk-run Silicon Valley darling would see its price collapse soon.

For his efforts, he ranks No. 21 on the Forbes list of the wealthy, with a net worth of $21.6 billion.

The Medallion Fund limits its assets to roughly $10 billion and is only available to Renaissance employees.For its part, Tesla completed a $2 billion secondary offering on Friday and analysts have continued to hold a bullish view on the company.
