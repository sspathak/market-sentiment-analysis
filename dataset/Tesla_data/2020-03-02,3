Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.33% surged 5.3% in morning trading Monday, putting them on track to snap a 5-day losing streak in which they tumbled 25.9%, amid concerns over the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The stock had lost 27.2% since closing at a record $917.42 on Feb. 19. In the face of the sharp selloff, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reiterated his underweight rating and $500 stock price target, which is 29% below current levels, saying investors should prepare for a "challenging" first quarter as he believes consensus forecasts for revenue and free cash flow will likely be coming down a bit. "Even before fully accounting for the broader impacts of the coronavirus, we expect 1Q 2020 to be notably weak as Tesla works through the China production and Model Y ramp and deals with potentially weaker demand in certain European markets (i.e. Netherlands) after a strong 4Q and less accommodative incentive environment," Jonas wrote in a note to clients. The stock has still more than doubled (up 110%) over the past three months, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.25% has shed 4.9%.
