Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted Saturday he will move the Silicon Valley car maker’s headquarters and operations out of California as the company’s main car-making factory remains closed.Musk also made good on a threat to sue Alameda County, where Tesla’s TSLA, +0.95%  Fremont car-making plant is located. Hours after tweeting that he will relocate, Musk filed a lawsuit in federal district court seeking an injunction to allow for the reopening of the Fremont site. He argued that the county where the factory is located has overreached and not uniformly applied its own rules to Tesla, which should have been allowed to stay open. “Alameda County’s power grab not only defies the governor’s orders, but offends the federal and California constitutions,” the lawsuit alleged. Local health authorities on Friday foiled Tesla’s plans to start reopening the factory, clarifying that, despite the reopening of some nonessential businesses elsewhere in the state, their own shutdown order prevailed.
