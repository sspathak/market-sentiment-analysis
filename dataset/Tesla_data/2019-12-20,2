If the rally continues, though, there will be more short covering as more short sellers hit their risk limits, S3 said.The total Tesla shares shorted is 25.46 million, just 1.23 million shares above the three-year low of 24.23 million shares shorted hit on Jan. 30, while the $10.29 billion in short interest is at last year’s average, S3 said. The number of Tesla shares shorted have not gone below 20 million since mid 2013. If the stock keeps “hitting historic highs we can expect short covering to accelerate as short mark-to-market losses mount,” S3 said. At this rate, the number of Tesla shares shorted would slid below 20 million shares if Tesla’s stock price hits $450 a share and another $1 billion of mark-to-market losses hits the short seller’s ledgers, S3 said.“What was a seven month long ‘hug’ is turning into a full-blown ‘squeeze.’”The recent gains have pushed Tesla gains for 2019 to 22%, compared with 29% and 22% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.22%  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. DJIA, +0.59%  Tesla’s market valuation is north of $73 billion, ahead of General Motors Co.’s GM, -0.34%  $53 billion and Ford Motor Co.’s F, +0.43%  $37 billion.
