Telsa Inc. stock TSLA, +4.23% was downgraded to hold from buy by Jefferies on Tuesday, with analyst saying valuation needs to be "grounded into some visibility on market size and potential profitability." Analysts led by Philippe Houchois raised their stock price target to $800 from $600, but said the rating move reflects the need for a clearer view on the upcoming battery business model. "We continue to see Tesla as uniquely engaged in a positive sum-game in the EV transition against legacy OEMs facing more severe strategic choices," the analysts wrote in a note to clients. Tesla shares have climbed 60% since Jan. 14, buoyed by accelerated de-leveraging from stronger-than-expected growth in free cash flow and the recent $2 billion plus equity raise that took place with minimal dilution. Growth guidance was raised above consensus for cars and energy generation and storage, they wrote. Battery news flow is improving with the stocks of pure-play battery makers up 30% to 50% year-to-date on strong fourth-quarter earnings. "A lot is riding on the upcoming battery day to gauge Tesla's addressable markets. Tesla has demonstrated a durable edge over competitors in energy density/mgt and connectivity and appears to have reviewed competitive technologies in detail in addition to pursuing its own development," said the note. Tesla shares rose 1.5% premarket and have gained 179% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.16% has gained 15%.
