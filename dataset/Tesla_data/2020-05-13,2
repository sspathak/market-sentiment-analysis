Alameda County officials said they have reviewed Tesla Inc.'s TSLA, +0.95% site-specific plan for reopening its Fremont, Calif. car-making plant and held "productive" discussions with the company about its safety and prevention plans during the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement, the county's public health department said it has added recommendations and if they are included and public health indicators remain stable or improve, Tesla could expand its minimum business operations this week for possible reopening as early as next week. "We will be working with the Fremont Police Department to verify Tesla is adhering to physical distancing and that agreed upon health and safety measures are in place for the safety of their workers as they prepare for full production," said the statement. Monday marks two weeks from the May 4 order that loosened restrictions, but the county will continue to monitor data as it decides on the pace of reopening. The statement comes after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk reopened the Fremont facility on Monday and tweeted that if local authorities wanted to arrest anyone, it should be him. Musk has railed against lockdown orders for weeks and even described them as "fascist" on Tesla's recent earnings call. His latest beef in weekend tweets was that the county of Alameda where the plant is based was not moving as fast as the state in loosening restrictions. The plant, which employs 10,000 workers, has been closed since March 23. Tesla shares were up 1.7% premarket and have gained 93% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.88% has fallen 11%.
