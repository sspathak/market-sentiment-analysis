Tesla Inc. is unlikely to make and sell as many vehicles in China as it had hoped, which weakens a key driver for the recent rally for the company’s stock.That’s from analyst Dan Ives at Wedbush, who tempered his Tesla TSLA, +4.37%  comments with hopes of a demand recovery later in the year and said Tesla’s overarching goal to sell half a million vehicles this year is likely still doable.“A major part of the Tesla bull thesis is centered around the company’s ability to ramp (Shanghai’s) Giga 3 production and demand in China to the key (3,000-vehicle) threshold per week over the next 12 to 18 months,” Ives said. “From a demand perspective we now believe hitting the 100k+ units level in the first year” of the Shanghai factory appears “unlikely,” given a demand overhang from the novel coronavirus outbreak, in China, he said.

Tesla shares are holding on to sizable gains due to its “meteoric” rise earlier in the year, thanks in large part to investors seeing the first vehicles come out of Tesla’s newly built Shanghai factory.
