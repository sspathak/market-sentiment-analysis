Analyst Bill Selesky of Argus Research on Tuesday raised his price target on Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.40% stock to $556, saying that last week's better-than-expected fourth-quarter deliveries, Tesla proxy for sales, highlight the popularity of the Model 3 and ongoing revenue growth from Model S and Model X sales. Selesky kept a buy rating on the stock. "Despite recent production delays, parts shortages, labor cost overruns, and a host of other difficulties, we expect the company to improve performance over time," he said in a note. Argus's $556 price target is among the highest on Wall Street; the average Tesla price target is $344.07, according to FactSet. Tesla shares notched a record close of $469.06 on Tuesday, thelatest in a series of high-water marks going back to mid-December.
