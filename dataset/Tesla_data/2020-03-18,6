Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.30% will keep its Fremont, Calif., factory open, but limit its workforce, Buzzfeed reported Wednesday. The status of the auto plant has been in question since the Alameda County Sheriff's Office tweeted Tuesday that Tesla's Fremont plant was a non-essential business and could only maintain "minimum basic operations" amid a regional shelter-in-place order to slow the spread of coronavirus. Tesla has not publicly commented on its operations since, and requests for comment have not been answered. Buzzfeed reported Wednesday that an Alameda County Sheriff's Office spokesperson said Tesla has committed to reducing its workforce from around 10,000 to around 2,500. It remains unclear if auto manufacturing will continue, and the timeline for the drawdown is not known. The San Jose Mercury News reported that employees had been told Wednesday to continue coming into work, despite the Bay Area-wide shutdown. CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly downplayed the risk of the COVID-19 outbreak on social media, tweeting earlier this month that "The coronavirus panic is dumb."
