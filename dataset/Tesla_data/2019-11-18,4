Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.92% tacked on 0.3% in premarket trading Monday, after Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner raised his price target by 12% ahead of the unveiling of its new electric pickup truck later this week, but the target remained well below current levels. Rosner reiterated his hold rating but lifted the target to $290, which is 17.7% below Friday's closing price of $352.17. Tesla's "Cybertruck" is expected to be unveiled on Nov. 21 in Los Angeles. "[A]ssuming most performance specifications are in line with those teased over time by [Chief Executive] Elon Musk, we expect focus to be on how well the actual design resonates with pickup buyers," Rosner wrote in a note to clients. "Musk has indicated it 'looks like an armored personnel carrier from the future,' from the set of Blade Runner, and is 'unrecognizable from the trucks from the past 20-40 years,' which we think could carry the risk of not attracting traditional pickup buyers, leaving it a lower-volume niche product." The stock has soared 60.1% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.21% has gained 8.0%.
