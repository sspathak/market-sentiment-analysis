Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.28% fell more than 5% in after-hours trading Tuesday after the Alameda County Sheriff's Department said in a tweet that its Fremont, Calif., factory was a non-essential business and may only maintain "minimum basic operations" amid a regional shelter-in-place order to slow the spread of coronavirus. It was unclear if that meant the factory would shut, in part or in whole, and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While the shelter-in-place went into effect Tuesday, workers reportedly showed up for work at the Tesla plant, though CEO Elon Musk said in an internal email that it was "totally OK" to stay home, the San Jose Mercury News reported, adding that Musk told employees he would continue coming to work every day. The factory employs about 10,000 people. Musk has downplayed the risk of coronavirus in tweets, saying Monday that the "danger of panic still far exceeds danger" of COVID-19.
