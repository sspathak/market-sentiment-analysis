UBS has lifted its price target on electric vehicle maker Tesla TSLA, +4.34% to $410 from $160 -- and kept a sell rating. UBS said it has a bullish outlook on Tesla, estimating 800,000 cars sold and a 10% operating margin in 2022, but the shares are priced for 1.4 million cars sold in 2025 at an 11% margin. "This is a stretch because it requires perfect execution, strong EV demand growth and at the same time failure of the incumbent OEMs to launch competitive EVs," said the UBS team led by Patrick Hummel. Tesla closed Wednesday at $569.56.
