Other theories have had adherents, but it is believed the association among the number “420,” the date in April and cannabis was established by a group of San Francisco high schoolers in the ’70s, when meeting at 4:20 p.m. after school. Musk, for his part, has had plenty to giggle over, after a period of controversy and relative stock stagnation.
