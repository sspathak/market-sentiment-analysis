Nearly all of its Model 3 orders came from people who did not hold a reservation, “solidifying the transition to generating strong organic demand,” Tesla said. “We are continuing to focus on increasing production to meet that demand,” it said. The delivery number should be viewed as “slightly conservative” as the company only counts a vehicle as sold after all paperwork has gone through, it said. Unlike some competitors, Tesla reports delivery, its proxy for sales, and production numbers quarterly, and doesn’t break it down by region or other variable. Earlier Wednesday, General Motors Co.
