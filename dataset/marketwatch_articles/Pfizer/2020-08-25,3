Salesforce, Amgen and Honeywell higher premarket on Dow-joining news; Exxon, Pfizer and Raytheon move lower

Shares of the three new additions to the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.64% were higher Tuesday, while the three departing members moved lower, a day after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced a shake-up for the 30-member index. Salesforce.com Inc. shares CRM, -3.29% rose 1.5%, on the news it will replace energy giant Exxon Mobil inc. XOM, -2.01%, which was down 0.7%. Amgen Inc. shares AMGN, -1.56% rose 3.2%, while Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.72%, which Amgen is replacing, was down 1.0%. Honeywell International Inc. shares HON, -0.69% rose 3.8%, while Raytheon Technologies Corp. RTX, +0.05%, which it's replacing, fell 1.3%. The changes will take place Aug. 31 and were prompted by Apple Inc.'s AAPL, -5.22% decision to carry out a 4-for-1 stock split, reducing the index's tech-sector weighting. "The announced changes help offset that reduction," S&P Dow Jones said in a statement. "They also help diversify the index by removing overlap between companies of similar scope and adding new types of businesses that better reflect the American economy."
