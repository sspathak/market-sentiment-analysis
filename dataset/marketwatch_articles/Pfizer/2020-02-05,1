Glaxo says adjusted EPS slips as it prepares to split into two companies

U.K. pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline GSK, +0.02% GSK, -0.80% said fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share fell 21% to 24.8 pence, while revenue rose 9% to £8.9 billion, as it also said it's planning to split into two companies in two years. Analysts polled by FactSet expected an EPS of 25.5 pence on revenue of £9 billion. Glaxo cited an increased non-controlling interest allocation of consumer healthcare profits and increased net finance costs, partly offset by a reduced effective tax rate, for the EPS decline. Revenue rose on the vaccine business as well as the acquisition of Pfizer's PFE, -0.48% consumer healthcare business. Glaxo says it expects adjusted EPS to fall between 1% and 4% at constant exchange rates for 2020, and is expecting to pay an 80 pence dividend. Glaxo said it will divide into an immune system-focused biopharma and a consumer healthcare company, and preparation costs will be between £600 million and £700 million. London-listed Glaxo shares slipped 0.2%.
