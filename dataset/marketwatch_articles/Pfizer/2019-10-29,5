Waiting Game. Stocks are treading water ahead of Tuesday’s open, with Dow Jones Industrial Average futures down 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq Composite futures are near the flat line. The holding pattern follows a record high close for the S&P 500 on Monday, with investors looking to earnings and the start of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting for guidance.

Alphabet (GOOGL) is down 0.9% to $1,277.06 following its disappointing earnings.

Beyond Meat (BYND) is down 18.7% to $85.71 despite better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and upbeat guidance.
