Shares of Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.48% gained 2.0% in premarket trading on Tuesday after the drugmaker beat expectations for the first quarter. The company had net earnings of $3.4 billion, or 60 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $3.9 billion, or 61 cents per share, in the first quarter of last year.

The company said it had a $150 million lift in the quarter that can be attributed to an 11% increase in global sales of its hospital products (some of which are used to intubate and support patients on mechanical ventilators) and a 29% jump in sales of its blood-thinner Eliquis, which was driven by COVID-19-related wholesaler purchases. It also restarted some clinical trials and launched new studies in late April after pausing some in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pfizer reaffirmed its 2020 revenue guidance of $48.5 billion to $50.5 billion in 2020 and it also reaffirmed adjusted EPS of $2.82 to $2.92 for the year.
