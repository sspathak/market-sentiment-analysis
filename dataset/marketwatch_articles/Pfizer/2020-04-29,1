Here are the stock market’s biggest winners on Wednesday as investors see new hope

Good news from Gilead Sciences and a statement from the Federal Reserve offset some grim economic numbers

U.S. stocks scored significant gains on Wednesday, as good news from Gilead Sciences and the Federal Reserve’s policy statement outweighed some dire economic numbers reflecting the price of the coronavirus shutdown.

• The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.52%  rose 532 points, or 2.2%, to close at 24,633.86, its best performance in nearly two weeks. The index is now down 16.6% from its closing high Feb. 12 but has jumped 32.5% from its 2020 closing low set March 23. (All figures in this article exclude dividends.)

• The S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.19%  was up 2.7% and ended 13.2% below its record closing level set Feb. 19.

• The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64%  soared 3.6% and ended 9.2% below its record closing high Feb. 19.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis said the U.S. economy had contracted at an annual rate of 4.8% during the first quarter. Lawrence Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, predicted a much worse second quarter followed by a “big snapback” in economic growth during the second half of the year.

Meanwhile, states continued to update their plans to reopen various sections of their economies.

Shares of Gilead Sciences GILD, -0.32%  jumped 6% after the company announced good results from trials of its remdesivir medication on COVID-19 patients. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said remdesivir had “a clear-cut significant positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery” during the trials.

The Federal Open Market Committee released its policy statement, announcing it would keep the federal funds rate in a target range of 0.00% to 0.25%, and that it would “use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.” You can see all the recent Federal Reserve policy announcements here.
