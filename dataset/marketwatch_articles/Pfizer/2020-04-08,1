These stocks rose the most Wednesday, as laggards from previous trading sessions bounced back

The S&P 500 Index was buoyed by the real estate, energy and utilities sectors


U.S. stocks rallied Wednesday, as some of the worst recent performers posted the biggest gains.

• The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.52%  shot up 780 points (or 3.4%) to close at 23,433.57. The index is now down 20.7% from its closing high Feb. 12. (All figures in this article exclude dividends.)

• The S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.19%  rose 3.4% and ended 18.8% below its closing high Feb. 19.

• The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64%  showed a more modest gain of 2.6% and ended 17.6% below its record closing level set Feb. 19.

The oil market gyrated, with West Texas Intermediate crude oil for May CL.1, -0.17%  reversing the previous day’s decline to rise more than 11%, after a slew of U.S. oil companies announced production cuts.

Among the S&P 500 SPX, +1.19%  sectors, real estate and energy were strongest Wednesday:

The “old” Arconic Rolled Products Corp. separated itself into two companies April 1, with the old company being renamed Howmet Aerospace and trading under the ticker HWM, +3.17%, and the “new” Arconic Corp. trading under the ticker ARNC, +3.39%  and retaining the formerly combined company’s aluminum rolled products business. So even though ARNC is the old ticker, on the list above, there is little history for the shares of the newly separated company. On Wednesday, ARNC announced a plan to cut its salaried workforce by 10% and reduce its CEO’s pay by 30%.  

All but two of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up Wednesday:
