Interest Rates Will Remain Low for Years. These High-Quality Stocks Might Offer the Income You Need.

With interest rates depressed and likely to remain so for years, stocks with ample and secure dividends could benefit as investors search for yield.

One approach is to consider companies whose dividend yields nicely exceed their bond yields. This can be a good way to find high-quality stocks because low bond yields are often a sign of financial strength and dividend stability.

David King, co-manager of the Columbia Flexible Capital Income fund, looks for such yield gaps as part of his investment strategy.

“The stock of any company whose safe dividend yield is materially higher than its own 10-year bond yield may have a compelling risk/reward profile,” King says. The approach, he says, doesn’t predict that a stock will outperform, but it has been very effective, “at identifying stocks with limited risk.”

He points to Johnson & Johnson (ticker: JNJ), whose dividend yield of 2.7% is more than double the about 1% on its 10-year debt. He says the wide gap indicates that investors are pessimistic about future dividend increases at J&J, despite a payout boost of 6% this year and bumps up at an annualized rate of 6% over the past five years.

Other examples are Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), and Edison International (EIX), which yield about 3%, 4%, and 5% respectively.
