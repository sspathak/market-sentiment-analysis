Opko Health Inc. shares OPK, +0.23% soared 21% in premarket trade Monday, while Pfizer Inc. shares PFE, -0.68% rose 0.6%, after the companies announced positive results in a late-stage trial of a human growth hormone treatment for children with growth hormone deficiency, or GHD. The companies said the phase 3 trial evaluating somatrogon dosed once a week in pre-pubertal children with GHD met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to daily GENOTROPIN(R) (somatropin) for injection, as measured by annual height velocity at 12 months. The trial involved 224 children around the world. GHD is a rare disease in which the pituitary gland does not secrete adequate amounts of growth hormone, affecting height and delaying puberty. The condition affects about 4,000 to 10,000 people. Opko and Pfizer are collaborating in developing the treatment, with Opko conducting the clinical program and Pfizer responsible for selling the product. Opko shares have fallen 30% in 2019 through Friday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.85% has gained 19%.
