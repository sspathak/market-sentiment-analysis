The Dow Is Edging Higher on Hope for a Vaccine and Earnings Expectations

Stocks are making small gains midday Wednesday, overcoming initial weakness, as hopes for a Covid-19 vaccine and forthcoming earnings reports outweigh escalating U.S.-China tensions.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were both up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat. Tech stocks have been a winner this year, and if the Nasdaq were to close with a gain, it would beat its record of 48 trading days without consecutive losses ending May 9, 1978. If it closes down, it will end the streak at 47 trading days, which would be the second-longest stretch on record.

Existing-home sales jumped in June. The report wasn’t perfect, but boosted investors’ moods, along with hopes for clarity on another round of stimulus. That was enough to overcome worry that relations between the U.S. and China continue to sour.

“It’s unclear if this potential tit-for-tat threatens the trade deal Beijing and Washington signed early this year, so stay tuned,” writes TD Ameritrade’s J.J. Kinahan. “In fact, it wouldn’t be too surprising if this relationship has more bumps in the road as the U.S. election approaches.”

That said, most investors are likely biding their time until the close of regular trading. After the bell, earnings reports are due from highflying stocks Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).

Among individual stocks, Best Buy (BBY) is up 7.8% after delivering an optimistic second-quarter update.

Biogen (BIIB) is rising 1.2% on its upbeat earnings, despite the departure of its chief financial officer.

Pfizer (PFE) is up 4.2% after saying it will charge less than $20 for its coronavirus vaccine.

Snap (SNAP) is down 7.6% after it warned sales growth could slow in the current quarter.
