3 S&P sectors climbed this week — here are the stocks that rose and fell the most

Investors anticipate an oil production deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia

Stocks ended the week with relatively moderate declines, considering the “new normal” of high volatility on most days of the coronavirus crisis. The week’s winners were mainly energy companies.

• The Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJIA  fell 361 points, or 1.7%, on Friday to close at 21,052.53. The index is down 2.7% from a week ago, down 28.8% from its closing high on Feb. 12 and down 26.2% so far in 2020. (All figures in this article exclude dividends.)

• The S&P 500 index US:SPX  lost 1.5% Friday for a one-week decline of 2.1%. The benchmark index has now fallen 26.5% from its closing high on Feb. 19 and is down 23% so far in 2020. This year’s slump, of course, follows a 28.9% jump in 2019. Considering how quickly the COVID-19 pandemic led to 10 million in new unemployment claims in two weeks, you may be surprised that the S&P 500 is down only 13.4% from a year ago.

• The Nadaq Composite Index US:COMP  was down 1.5% on Friday for a one-week decline of 1.7%. The index is down 24.9% from its record close on Feb. 19 and down 17.8% so far in 2020.

The oil story
After President Trump called Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said on Thursday via Twitter that he expected the countries to cut oil production by 10 million barrels a day. The president is trying to help U.S. shale oil producers — who have relatively high production costs — survive the lack of demand, which has been exacerbated by production increases by Saudi Arabia and Russia. Myra Saefong explained that the U.S. will have to cooperate in an OPEC+ production cut in order for it to be effective.

West Texas Crude intermediate oil for May delivery US:CLK20 ended Friday at $28.34 a barrel, for a 31.8% leap over the week.
