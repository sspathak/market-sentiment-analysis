Dow, Exxon Mobil and IBM top the 'Dogs of the Dow' list as 2019 ends

Although it's debatable whether following the Dogs of the Dow strategy--buying and holding the 10 highest yielding Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.52% components at year end--actually works better than its catchy name, here are the stocks that would make the list as 2019 comes to a close: 1) Dow Inc. DOW, +2.36% with a dividend yield of 5.14%; 2) Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +4.43%, yielding 5.02%; 3) International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +2.11%, yielding 4.86%; 4) Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +0.79% which yields 4.03%; 5) Chevron Corp. CVX, +2.87% yields 3.97%; 6) Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.48% with a yield of 3.90%; 7) 3M Co. MMM, -0.03%, which yields 3.28%; 8) Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, -3.09%, with a yield of 3.10%; 9) Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.05% yields 2.93%; and 10) Coca-Cola Co. KO, +0.12% yields 2.90%. MarketWatch contributor Mark Hulbert wrote Thursday that the Dogs of the Dow strategy has not outperformed the Dow on a total return basis over the past two decades. Meanwhile, the average yield of the 30 Dow components is 2.61% (median 2.53%), while the implied yield for the S&P 500 is 1.86%, according to FactSet.
