Since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic March 11, the U.S. has suffered more than 100,000 deaths from the deadly virus, the economy was shuttered and then slowly reopened, and the investing markets produced record volatility.

U.S. stocks hit their peak the previous month, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average registering an all-time closing high Feb. 12, and the S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite Index following suit Feb. 19.

June 19 will mark 100 days since the WHO’s declaration. Since March 10, a day earlier, the Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJIA  rose 4.4% through the close June 17. The S&P 500 US:SPX  has risen 8%, and the Nasdaq US:COMP  has soared 18.8%. (Price changes in this article exclude dividends.)
