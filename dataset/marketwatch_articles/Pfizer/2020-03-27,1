Here are Thursday’s best-performing stocks as the Dow Jones Industrial Average produces a three-day gain of 21%

Boeing led the Dow higher Thursday. Still, the index is down 24% from its record closing high last month

U.S. stocks posted another big gain Thursday, despite a depressing unemployment report, as investors expected the House of Representatives to pass the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill after the Senate did the same.

• The Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJIA  soared 1,352 points (or 6.4%) to close at 22,552.17. That made for three straight sessions of increases, for a gain of 21.3% since the Dow closed at 18,591.93 on Monday. So there’s a new bull market for the Dow, with a run of more than 20%. Then again, the Dow is down 23.7% from its record closing high Feb. 12. (All prices in this article exclude dividends.)

• The S&P 500 Index US:SPX  was up 6.2% on Thursday, also rising for a third straight day. The benchmark was up 17.6% from Monday’s close, but down 22.3% from its closing high Feb. 19.

• The Nasdaq Composite Index US:COMP  was up 5.6% on Thursday, also rising for a third straight day, bringing the total gain to 13.7% since the close Monday. The Nasdaq was down 20.6% from its closing high Feb. 19.

Investors were relieved that the Senate passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief & Economic Security Act. The House of Representatives is widely expected to pass the bill Friday and send it to President Trump for signing into law. The bill includes provisions for small businesses, student-loan borrowers, an extra $600 a week for people collecting unemployment benefits, and direct payments to individuals and families.

As if to underline the importance of the CARES Act, Thursday’s unemployment figures included a record 3.28 million in claims for the week ended March 21.

MarketWatch’s Mark Hulbert warned that investors’ euphoric reaction to the Senate’s action doesn’t mean the stock market is anywhere near bottoming amid the coronavirus crisis.

Dow 30
All but one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up Thursday:
Boeing US:BA  is another example of how tremendous recent gains need to be put into perspective. After four straight sessions of double-digit gains, the stock was up 90% since the close on Friday, March 20. But the shares were down 47% since the S&P 500 set its closing record on Feb. 19, down 45% in 2020 and down 51% from a year earlier. The CARES bill includes up to $500 billion in “subsidy amounts” for loans, loan guarantees and “other investments” in companies of all sizes. It remains to be seen how much, if any, aid Boeing will receive from the federal government.

S&P 500
On Thursday, 469 components of the S&P 500 were up, with 79 showing double-digit gains. All 11 sectors posted gains:
