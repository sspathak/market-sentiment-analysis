Pfizer, BioNTech's COVID vaccine candidate enters late-stage trial

Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.69% and BioNTech SE BNTX, -1.31% said late Monday they have started a late-stage clinical trial for one of their COVID-19 vaccine candidates, involving 30,000 people around the world. The start of the trial "is a major step forward in our progress toward providing a potential vaccine to help fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and we look forward to generating additional data as the program progresses," said in a statement Pfizer's head of vaccine research and development Kathrin U. Jansen. Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine candidates have triggered T-cell responses in participants in addition to neutralizing antibody titers, and one of them is moving forward to the larger trial. A T-cell response is thought to be critical in order for the human body to develop immunity to the novel coronavirus, and the Pfizer-BioNTech candidates and an AstraZeneca Plc AZN, -1.13% candidate were the first vaccine candidates to show some response on the T-cells, a key component of the human body's immune system. Several companies are racing to arrive at a COVID-19 vaccine, with some believing that a vaccine could be available later this year or early in 2021.
