Pfizer's stock tumbles to pace the Dow's decliners, would cut about 17 points off the Dow's price

Share of Pfizer Inc. PFE, 0.27% tumbled 6.5% in premarket trading Monday, enough to pace all of the Dow Jones Industrial Average' DJIA, -0.65% s early decliners after the drug maker said it halted a study of a potential breast-cancer treatment. The implied price decline would shave about 17 points off the Dow's price, while Dow futures YM00, -0.55% were down 45 points. Pfizer's stock is the lowest priced component of the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning percentage changes in Pfizer's stock have the least influence of the 30 components. For example, a 1% change in Pfizer's stock moves the Dow by about 2.6 points, while a 1% move in Apple Inc.'s stock AAPL, -5.02%, which is the highest priced Dow components, would move the Dow by 21.6 points. Late Friday, Pfizer said a phase 3 trial of palbociclib, also known as Ibrance, did not reach its intended change in survival rates. Pfizer's stock has run up 14.3% over the past three months through Friday, while the Dow has slipped 0.1%.
