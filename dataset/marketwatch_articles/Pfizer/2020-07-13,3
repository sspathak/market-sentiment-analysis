The Dow Is Flying, PepsiCo Stock Is Jumping, and Tesla Is Climbing Again

U.S. stocks caught a bid early Monday morning as investors turned their attention away from rising coronavirus cases and looked to earnings season as companies begin to report their quarterly financial results. PepsiCo (PEP) kicked off the reporting and the big banks will report later this week, starting with JPMorgan Chase (ticker: JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) on Tuesday.

Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 208 points, or 0.8% while S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite futures gained 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively.

PepsiCo shares gained 2% premarket as the beverage and snack maker kicked off earnings season and released better-than-expected results from the second quarter. Pepsi didn’t release guidance, citing uncertainties tied to the coronavirus pandemic, but it said it planned to return $7.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

Analog Devices (ADI) shares climbed 2.4% premarket after announcing plans to buy rival chip maker Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) in a $21 billion deal. Maxim shares surged 18% premarket.

Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech SE (BNTX) shares climbed 3% and 11% premarket after two of their vaccine candidates were granted “fast track” status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Tesla (TSLA) shares continued their rally, climbing 6.2% premarket, after slashing the price of its model Y SUV by $3,000.
