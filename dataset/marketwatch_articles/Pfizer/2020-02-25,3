These U.S. stocks skidded the most Tuesday as the market slides for the fourth straight day

Travel companies were among the hardest-hit stocks Tuesday as investors grew more concerned about the spread of the COVID-19 virus outside of China and punished U.S. benchmarks for the fourth straight session.

Adding to the concerns, an official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned the American public to prepare for “the possibility that their lives will be disrupted,” while referring to the virus as a “pandemic.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.52%  dropped 879 points, or 3.1%, to close at 27,081.36, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.19%  declined 3% after the day’s early gains evaporated. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64%  lost 2.8%.

As bond prices rose, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.820%  moved as low as 1.31% — an all-time low — before ending at 1.34%.

Meanwhile, MarketWatch’s Howard Gold described the market selloff as a buying opportunity for investors.
