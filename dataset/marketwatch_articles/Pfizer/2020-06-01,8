Dow notches first gain in 3 sessions to kick of June as stock market shakes off worry about civil unrest and China

The Dow Jones Industrial booked its first gain of the past three sessions on Monday to start trading for the week and month of June. Markets appeared to be heartened by upbeat data from the Institute for Supply Management, whose manufacturing index for May rose to 43.1 from an 11-year low of 41.5 in April. A reading above 50.0 indicates an increase in activity, while a one below that level indicates contraction. The report indicated to many investors that the worst of the economic problems from closures induced by COVID-19 may be reaching a peak. The Dow DJIA, -0.70% rose nearly 92 points, or 0.4%, at 25,475, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.81% climbed 0.4% at about 3,056, while Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.53% advanced 0.7% at around 9,552. Markets appeared to focus on reopenings from the lockdowns that were intended to limit the spread of the novel strain of coronavirus, which appeared to overshadow protests over the weekend centered on the death of George Floyd, a black man who died under the knee of a white police officer last week in Minnesota. On the international front, Chinese government officials told major state-run agricultural companies to pause purchases of some American farm goods, including pork and soybeans, Reuters and Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.
