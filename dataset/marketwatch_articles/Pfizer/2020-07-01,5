Dow Turns Losses Into Gains After Pfizer Releases Vaccine Data

10:25 a.m. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has turned a more than 200-point pre-market loss into a nearly 100-point gain after Pfizer (PFE) announced positive trial results from a coronavirus vaccine.

The Dow has risen 94.27 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 has advanced 0.5%. The Nasdaq Composite has gained 0.5%.

Pfizer, which is working with BioNTech (BNTX) on the vaccines, released Phase ½ trial data that involved 45 patients, and pointed to possible efficacy of the vaccines. “This is clearly good news, and we have highlighted PFE and BNTX’s program as one of the most promising vaccine programs in the fight against COVID-19,” writes Cantor analyst Louise Chen.

That news seemed to supersede any worries about the spread of coronavirus or that the market was overbought following its massive second-quarter rally.

The vaccine wasn’t the only good news. The Institute for Supply Management released its manufacturing index, which came in at 52.6, above forecasts for 49.8. A reading of 50 or higher indicates expansion, which isn’t hard to do off these depressed levels. That news was good enough to lift the 10-year Treasury yield to 0.699%, up 0.046 percentage point.

Now it just needs to hold.
