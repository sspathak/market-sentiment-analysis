These stocks soared the most after Biden burned Bernie on Super Tuesday

Health-care stocks led the market rally after Biden took 10 of 14 states, becoming the Democratic front runner


U.S. stocks staged a massive rally Wednesday, with health-care companies leading the charge after former Vice President Joe Biden jumped ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the race toward the Democratic presidential nomination.

After Biden took 10 of 14 states Super Tuesday to overtake Sanders in the delegate count and become the Democratic front runner, Michael Bloomberg dropped out of the race and threw his support behind Biden, following Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg over the previous few days.
