Here are the biggest stock-market winners April 6, as major indexes jump at least 7%


Many of the strongest performers were consumer-discretionary stocks that have been hit hard by the economic shutdown


Hope that new coronavirus cases are close to cresting in New York, as well as declining death rates in Europe, fueled increases in U.S. stock prices Monday. Some of the best performers were consumer-discretionary stocks that have been hit hard since mid-February.

• The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.52%  soared 1,627 points (or 7.7%) to close at 22,679.99. The index is now down 22.7% from its closing high Feb. 12. (All figures in this article exclude dividends.)

• The S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.19%  added 7% and ended 21.3% below its closing high Feb. 19. Michael Kagan, a portfolio manager at ClearBridge Investments in New York, called the S&P 500’s decline mild, considering the spike of the COVID-19 crisis, because the index was close to the level where it began 2019. Some of the stocks that have been hit hardest during the crisis led the benchmark higher with double-digit increases — they are listed below.

• The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64%  climbed 7.3% and ended 19.4% below its record closing level set Feb. 19.

Here’s a full update of coronavirus infections and death rates, with good news from Europe and hopeful signs in New York, but an accelerating infection rate in Japan.

The S&P 500 has now risen 21.5% from its crisis-period intraday low March 23. However, opinions about whether we have seen the worst of the stock-market fallout from the coronavirus are decidedly mixed:

• Investors should prepare for a coronavirus-induced ‘vicious spiral’ more than twice as bad as the financial crisis, says J.P. Morgan

• ‘The worst is behind us’ — with the most attractive risk-reward in years, it is time to buy stocks, Morgan Stanley says

• Wall Street veteran of half a century warns of an ‘L-shaped’ economic recovery
