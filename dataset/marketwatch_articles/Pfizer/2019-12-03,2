Here are the worst-performing U.S. stocks on Tuesday

Investors in U.S. stocks suffered a broad decline Tuesday, as President Trump suggested a trade deal with China may not get done any time soon.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.29%  fell as much as 1.7%, while the S&P 500 Index SPX, -1.85%  declined as much as 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.64%  dropped as much as 1.6%.

At a press conference in London, the president said it was “better to wait until after the election” in November 2020, when discussing the prospects of a near-term trade deal.
