The Arms Race in Vaccines Continues as Glaxo Buys Stake in mRNA Company

GlaxoSmithKline on Monday said it was taking a 10% stake in German biotech CureVac, as the arms race for vaccines continues.

As part of a deal valued at up to £866 million ($1.09 billion), GlaxoSmithKline will pay £130 million for a nearly 10% stake in CureVac, which also counts the German government as a minority owner.

GlaxoSmithKline and CureVac reached an agreement for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of up to five mRNA-based vaccines and monoclonal antibodies targeting infectious disease pathogens. Glaxo shares edged lower in London trade on Monday.

Vaccines accounted for about a fifth of Glaxo’s revenue in the first quarter.

The back story. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought vaccines to the forefront of investors’ minds, though CureVac’s coronavirus vaccine candidate isn’t directly part of this deal.

Messenger RNA technology is what is used by other biotechnology companies, including Moderna and BioNTech, to develop vaccines. The U.K. government on Monday separately said it has secured early access to 90 million vaccine doses of two possible Covid-19 vaccines being developed by a partnership between Germany’s BioNTech and U.S. drugmaker Pfizer, as well as one by French group Valneva.
