These U.S. stocks fell the most April 1 after Trump turned grim on coronavirus forecast

Utility, real estate and financial stocks led the declines as three major indexes drop 4.4%

U.S. stocks began the second quarter Wednesday with big declines after President Trump’s tone when discussing potential COVID-19 deaths turned dire. Investors punished some of the hardest-hit industries of the pandemic, including airlines and cruise lines. Financial stocks also took a beating.
