UNC Moves to Online Classes After Coronavirus Outbreak

Here’s what you need to know about the impact of Covid-19 to navigate the markets today.

• The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will move to all-remote classes for undergraduates one week after classes started due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus on campus. Currently 177 students are in isolation and 349 are in quarantine, the school said. UNC System President Peter Hans urged students to wear face coverings and maintain social distance, saying that doing so was “critical to the success of this semester and to protect public health.” The state university is one of the largest in the country with students.

• The Commerce Department said Monday that it was restricting Chinese tech-giant Huawei’s access to foreign chips made using U.S. technology. The new rule is in addition to the export restrictions imposed by the Trump administration against Huawei in May that limited foreign chip-makers from being able to ship chips designed by Huawei without requesting a license from the U.S. first. “As we have restricted its access to U.S. technology, Huawei and its affiliates have worked through third parties to harness U.S. technology in a manner that undermines U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. “This multi-pronged action demonstrates our continuing commitment to impede Huawei’s ability to do so.”

• Gyms in New York state can open on Aug. 24 with occupancy at a third of normal levels, required mask wearing and upgraded ventilation systems, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Monday. The reopening of gyms had been delayed in the state, with both New York City and state officials pointing to outbreaks in other states that were tied to gyms. Just 0.7% of Covid-19 tests done in New York state on Sunday came back positive, Gov. Cuomo said Monday.

• Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) called the U.S. House of Representatives back early from its August recess byto vote on legislation that would keep the U.S. Postal Service from making operational changes. A vote would likely be on Saturday, The Wall Street Journal reported. The decision comes after the USPS warned that it can’t be sure it will be able to deliver ballots quickly enough to ensure they are counted in November and President Donald Trump has continued to attack mail-in voting. Senate Republicans and the White House have balked at additional funding for the USPS that Democrats provided in their coronavirus relief bill that passed the House in May.

• Italy ordered nightclubs to close for at least three weeks and made mask wearing mandatory outdoors in areas near bars where crowds are likely as it seeks to contain an increase in coronavirus infections. The age of Covid-19 patients in the country has dropped significantly, with the median age of cases now below 40. Italy was hit with a terrible Covid-19 outbreak that killed 35,000 earlier this year. “We cannot nullify the sacrifices made in past months,” Health Minister Roberto Speranza said in a message posted on Facebook. “Our priority must be that of opening schools in September, in full safety.” The country has 629 new cases on Saturday and 479 on Sunday.

• Novavax has begun Phase 2 testing of its possible Covid-19 vaccine, the company said Monday. If it is shown to be safe in the current trials, Novavax said a Phase 3 trial could begin as early as September. The company’s efforts are being supported by $15 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Potential vaccines developed by Moderna, AstraZeneca and Oxford University, and Pfizer and BioNTech have each begun large-scale Phase 3 trials that will hopefully yield results by the fall.

• New Zealand has delayed its national election, which was originally scheduled for Sept. 19, until Oct. 17, due to a small coronavirus outbreak in Auckland. The cases in the country’s largest city prompted a swift and significant reaction from the government, resulting in about a third of voters now being placed under lock down orders. “I absolutely have confidence we can and will deliver a safe election,” said New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. She said that there wouldn’t be another delay. Before the recent cases were discovered in Auckland, New Zealand had gone more than 100 days without a single Covid-19 case due to local transmission.
