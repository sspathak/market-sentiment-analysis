CureVac Stock Jumps on News of EU Talks to Supply Covid-19

The German biotech CureVac, which has seen its share price soar since its initial public offering last week, is climbing again on Thursday morning, this time on news that it is in talks to sell 225 million doses of its experimental Covid-19 vaccine to the European Commission.

Shares of CureVac (ticker: CVAC) were up 9.8% on Thursday morning. The stock began trading last Friday at $44 per share, well above its IPO price of $16 per share. It closed Wednesday at $56.90, and was trading Thursday morning at $62.48.

In a statement Thursday, CureVac said it had “concluded exploratory talks outlining an Advanced Purchase Agreement” with the European Commission. Under the terms of the potential deal, the European Commission would buy 225 million doses of the vaccine, with an option of buying another 180 million doses.

Delivery would not take place until the drug was proven safe and effective. CureVac’s Covid-19 vaccine is, like Moderna’s (MRNA) and Pfizer’s (PFE), based on messenger RNA, a relatively novel technology. No messenger-RNA drugs or vaccines are currently approved anywhere in the world. The CureVac vaccine is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials, which the company says will provide data early in the fourth quarter of this year.

CureVac is the latest mRNA-focused firm to see its valuation skyrocket amid the Covid-19 vaccine race. Competitors Moderna and BioNTech (BNTX), which is collaborating with Pfizer on its Covid-19 vaccine, have seen their share prices rise 243% and 93% this year, respectively.

“In the current pandemic, we are very pleased to further strengthen the European Commission’s endeavor to provide rapid access to a safe and effective vaccine against the Covid-19 virus across Europe and beyond,” CureVac CEO Dr. Franz-Werner Haas said in a statement. “Assuming positive results from our ongoing clinical trials and approval from the regulatory authorities, we are fully committed to ensure broad access to our vaccine.”

The potential deal is the first to be announced by CureVac, which hopes to begin Phase 2b/3 trials of the vaccine in the fourth quarter of this year.

The CureVac press release did not offer details on the pricing contemplated in the exploratory talks. The European Commission has also engaged in exploratory talks with Sanofi (SNY) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) about buying 300 million doses of their Covid-19 vaccine, and with Johsnon & Johnson (JNJ) about buying 200 million doses of their Covid-19 vaccine. It has finalized a deal with to buy 300 million doses of AstraZeneca’s (AZN) Covid-19 vaccine.

The European Investment Bank, the European Union’s lending arm, loaned €75 million to CureVac in July to develop and produce vaccines.

“Each round of talks that we conclude with the pharmaceutical industry brings us closer to beating this virus,” said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a statement. “We will soon have an agreement with CureVac.”
