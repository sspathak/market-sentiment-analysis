Pfizer Inc. shares PFE, -0.68% rose 3.3% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the drug company beat earnings estimates for the third quarter and raised its profit guidance. New York-based Pfizer said it had net income of $7.680 billion, or $1.36 a share, in the quarter, up from $4.114 billion, or 69 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 75 cents, ahead of the 62 cents FactSet consensus. Revenue fell 5% to $12.680 billion from $13.298 billion, but topped the FactSet consensus of $12.261 billion. The company tweaked its full-year guidance and now expects adjusted EPS to range from $2.94 to $3.00, up from prior guidance of $2.76 to $2.86. Revenue is expected to range from $51.2 billion to $52.2 billion, compared with prior guidance of $50.5 billion to $52.5 billion. "We reported strong third-quarter 2019 financial results, driven by 9% volume-driven operational revenue growth in our Biopharma business, including growth from key brands such as Ibrance, Xeljanz, Eliquis, Vyndaqel and Inlyta as well as in emerging markets," Chief Executive Dr. Albert Bourla said in a statement. "Upjohn revenues were negatively impacted primarily by the July 2019 loss of exclusivity of Lyrica in the U.S., while Consumer Healthcare revenues declined as a result of the completion of the JV transaction with GSK(1) during the quarter." Shares have fallen 15% in 2019, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.29% has gained 16% and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.85% has gained 21%.
