Stocks open slightly higher as U.S., China reaffirm commitment to trade deal

Stocks opened higher Tuesday, with the S&P 500 SPX, -1.99% trading at an all-time intraday high as it built on the previous session's record close. A positive tone for global equities was attributed in part to a phone call between top U.S. and Chinese officials that saw them reaffirm their commitment to the phase one trade deal agreed to earlier this year, despite a rise in tensions between Beijing and Washington. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.67% was off 8 points at 28,300, flipping between small gains and losses. The S&P 500 was up 3 points, or 0.1%, at 3,434, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -2.93% was up less than 0.1% at 11,383. Shares of Dow components Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, -2.09%, Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.74% and Raytheon Technologies Corp. RTX, -0.19% were under pressure after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced late Monday that they would be taken out of the blue-chip gauge at the end of the month, to be replaced by Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, -3.50%, Amgen Inc. AMGN, -1.53% and Honeywell International Inc. HON, -0.69%.
