Pfizer Stock Is Jumping, Best Buy Soars, and the Dow Edges Down

U.S. stock futures ticked lower Wednesday morning as Wall Street worried about continued tensions between the U.S. and China as well as continuing fears about the coronavirus and the toll it has taken on the economy.

On the U.S.-China front, tensions escalated after the U.S. State Department ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, saying that the move was done to protect American intellectual property and citizens’ private information. China vowed retaliation.

Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 60 points, or 0.2%, matching the percentage-point loss in S&P 500 futures. Nasdaq Composite futures climbed 0.2%.

The price of oil also fell early Wednesday, with West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude falling 1.6% to $41.24 a barrel.The price of Brent crude dipped 1.4% to $43.70 a barrel.

Pfizer (ticker: PFE) and BioNTech SE (BNTX) shares popped premarket after securing nearly $2 billion from the U.S. government to produce and deliver 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidate. The government has the option to acquire an additional 500 million doses. Pfizer shares were up 4.7% while BioNTech shares climbed 6.1%.

Best Buy (BBY) shares were up 5.1% after management reported a surge in sales during the prior quarter as households rushed to outfit their homes for work and play during stay-at-home orders. Those gains have even continued in the current quarter, the company said as it reported its financial results late Tuesday.

Snap (SNAP) shares fell 7% even though the company behind Snapchat delivered second-quarter results that were largely in line with analysts’ targets late Tuesday. Wall Street appears to have been spooked when the company warned that third-quarter sales growth would slow.
