Lilly Stock Has a 10% Upside, Guggenheim Says

The success of the Lilly drug Verzenio in preventing breast-cancer recurrence was a happy surprise Tuesday, following as it did the failure of a Pfizer product last month in a similar test.

Guggenheim analyst Seamus Fernandez reacted to Lilly’s good news by upgrading its stock to a Buy in a Tuesday afternoon note. Lilly stock (ticker: LLY) was trading at $162.19 early Wednesday. Fernandez thinks it can rise more than 10%, to $182.

The analyst calls Verzenio’s success in the breast-cancer study a “transformational event” for Lilly that could be worth another $2.5 billion in sales for its cancer drug. Verzenio belongs to a class of drugs known as CDK 4 & 6 inhibitors that block the development of certain cancer cells. Products from Pfizer (PFE), Lilly, and Novartis (NVS) have been approved as treatments for advanced breast cancer.

Pfizer’s Ibrance is the big seller in the drug category, with more than $4 billion in annual revenue. But the company—and cancer patients—suffered a disappointment when Ibrance failed to make a difference when used to prevent recurrence after treatment of early cases of breast cancer—a kind of use known as adjuvant treatment. Fernandez writes that Guggenheim’s cancer doctor consultants were discouraged about the whole class of CDK inhibitors as adjuvant treatments.

That’s why the Lilly product’s success in its adjuvant trial was a significant surprise for doctors and investors, says the analyst.
