Pfizer Stock Is Treading Water, but Director Ronald Blaylock Made a Big Buy

Pfizer stock is in the red by about 3% this year, but director Ronald Blaylock has made the biggest purchase of shares of the drug giant by an insider in years.

Blaylock paid $501,000 on Aug. 6 for 13,000 Pfizer shares (ticker: PFE), an average price of $38.55 each. Those shares now represent all of Blaylock’s ownership of Pfizer shares, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC records also show he owns 28,222 phantom units, which are settled in cash or stock upon retirement from the board. A founder and managing partner of private-equity firm Gennx360 Capital Partners, Blaylock joined Pfizer’s board in 2017.

Gennx360 didn’t respond to a request to make Blaylock available for comment on his stock transactions.
Pfizer stock is one of our bullish picks for 2020. At the end of 2019, we were upbeat about Pfizer’s plan to combine its generic-drug business with Mylan (MYL) and then spin off a majority stake in the combined company. That deal had been set for the middle of the year, but in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, it has been pushed to the second half. In any case, we like the valuation of Pfizer shares and the company’s strong pipeline.

Not only is Blaylock’s stock purchase his first on the open market, it is also the largest such purchase in volume and value by any Pfizer executive or director since at least 2003, which is the extent of SEC online records.

Pfizer is one of a number of firms that will help Gilead Sciences (GILD) make remdesivir, the experimental antiviral that got emergency approval in May as a treatment for Covid-19.
