The Dow Slips Because Consumers ‘Are Understandably Cautious’

Stock weakness continued into midday Tuesday, as investors digested earnings results, government stimulus negotiations, and lower consumer-confidence figures.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4%, the Nasdaq Composite was off 0.5%, and the S&P 500 slipped 0.1%.

U.S. consumer confidence took a hit this month amid rising Covid-19 cases. “The bottom line is that the consumer sector and the economy broadly remain vulnerable as policymakers assess the evolving public health risk created by Covid-19,” noted Plante Moran Financial Advisors’ Chief Investment Officer Jim Baird. “Any aggressive steps that may be taken to clamp down on its spread may be beneficial in reducing health risk, but could at the same time exacerbate economic conditions and endanger a fragile recovery.  Consumers are clearly aware of that risk and are understandably cautious in their assessment of the path forward for the next several months.”

Lawmakers are trying to agree on another round of government assistance, although Democrats and Republicans remain at odds about the specifics of the package.
